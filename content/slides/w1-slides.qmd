# Course logistics and learning objectives {.bkrd-color-2}
## What this course is about
:::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: box-1-list
This course is an introduction to the application of statistical methods with biological and ecological data that is ***temporally*** or ***spatially*** structured.
:::
::::

:::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: box-1-list
We'll emphasize: working with data, formulating hypotheses, constructing models, testing assumptions, and doing basic statistical inference and reporting.
:::
::::

## What this course isn't
:::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: box-2-list
We're not here to discuss theoretical statistics: we'll be focused on ***applying foundational statistical tools***
:::
::::

:::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: box-2-list
Memorizing equations and hand-calculating t-tests and ANOVAs <p class="tiny-font">*(but, sometimes the latter can be helpful...)*</p>
:::
::::

## Some basic expectations
:::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: box-6-list
I do expect folks have a working understanding of basic calculus and statistics from past classes in high school or undergraduate studies
:::
::::

:::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: box-6-list
It's ok to feel lost or get frustrated. Analyzing data (and working with {{< fa brands r-project title="R Project" >}}) is hard!
:::
::::

:::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: box-6-list
Ask questions! Work together! Treat this not like a class, but like a semester long workshop
:::
::::

## Learning objectives for the semester {.smaller .incremental}
1. Apply the appropriate techniques to characterize spatial and temporal dependence data
2. Understand how spatial and temporal dependence can affect statistical inference
3. Identify and choose the appropriate analytical methods to contend with such dependence in widely-used statistical methods like regression and ANOVA
4. Critically evaluate and understand the strengths and limits of these approaches
5. Present analytical results in a format befitting a scientific presentation or publication

## Attendance {.smaller}
Syllabus is pretty clear on this, I hope you want to be here!

## AI, LLMs, and Bullshit {.smaller}
:::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: box-1-list
I **highly** recommend **NOT** using generative AI tools in this course

:::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: {.callout-tip}
There are times when using AI tools are appropriate, but learning to recognize those instances is critical to your learning.
:::
::::
:::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: {.callout-warning}
If you use LLMs in your work, be honest and report how and why you used them
