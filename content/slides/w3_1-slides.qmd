# Statistical method

## Statistical method

. . . 

::: box-6-list
Our typical approach to answering scientific questions uses [inductive reasoning]{.highlight-tomato}: attempting to form generalities from specific cases (i.e., data)
:::

[<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> The sparrows nest outside my window is made of grass]{.indented-text}

[<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> The nest (and my window) is near a grassland]{.indented-text}

. . . 

[<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> Sparrows use grasses in their nests because grass is more abundant in their habitat]{.indented-text}

. . . 

::: {.callout-important}
We will also use [deductive reasoning]{.highlight-tomato} (general --> specific) to derive specific predictions from our general hypotheses (e.g., If sparrows use grass because it is more abundant, then sparrows in a woodland habitat should use more twigs)
:::

## A formal statistical method

:::{.incremental}
1. State research question 
2. Formulate null and alternative hypotheses
3. Identify population variable and, when possible, its distribution
4. Sample data according to chosen sampling procedure
5. Examine your data
6. Determine and calculate appropriate test statistic
7. Reject or "accept" null hypothesis
8. State conclusion and answer question in step 1
:::

## What we DON'T do

:::{.incremental}
1. State research question
2. Formulate null and alternative hypotheses
3. Formulate conclusion based on perception, prior knowledge, or other maligned incentive
4. Identify population variable and distribution 
5. Sample data according to chosen sampling procedure
6. Examine data
7. Determine and calculate test statistic most likely to conform to predetermined conclusion
8. Reject or "accept" null hypothesis
9. State "conclusion" and answer question in step 1

## Danger!
This process is one of many ways to "p-hack" your way to "significant" results

# Measures of spread and location

## The values we often care most about in our data...

::: box-6-list
As we discussed last week, we often don't care about the entire population distribution that our data come from -- we want to know something about the expected value (the mean, $\mu$) and the variation, or variance, around this value ($\sigma^2$). We will most often work with...
:::

. . . 

The arithmetic mean: $\bar{Y} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_i}{n}$ 

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> This value is an unbiased estimate of our population mean, $\mu$, provided that: (1) our observations are  
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> (1) our observations are randomly sampled
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> (2) our observations are independent of one another
:::

:::

. . . 

The variance: $s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_i - \bar{Y})^2}{n}$ 

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> Here, we calculate variance by subtracting our mean value from our observed values and squaring them (this is called the sum of squares) and divide by the sample size, $n$. 
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> However, if we utilize this calculation to estimate our population variance using our sample variance, we will ALWAYS *underestimate* the true value. 
:::

. . . 

$$
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_i - \bar{Y})^2}{n} < \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_i - \mu)^2}{n}
$$

# Degrees of Freedom

<!--
## *df*: degrees of what? 
::: box-6-list
We're putting all of the pieces in place to begin doing statistical tests of our data
:::

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> A key component of most statistical tests is the [degrees of freedom]{.highlight-tomato} of the reference distribution of our tests statistic (e.g., *t*, *F*)
:::

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> It's very important, but can be a bit of a mind-bending process to fully comprehend. Let's break it down.
:::

## Example using sample variance

. . . 

We learned that sample variance ($s^2$) is calculated as: 

$$
s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar x)^2}{n-1}
$$

where $x$ is a given sample, and $\bar x$ is the sample mean.

. . . 

::: box-6-list
Why do we divide by $n-1$ but not by $n$?
:::
-->

## Degrees of freedom
::: box-6-list
In this case, $n-1$ is the [degrees of freedom]{.highlight-tomato} in our sample. This refers to the number of observations within our sample that are free to vary.
:::

. . . 

Put another way, it's the number of observations that you would need to recover all of the information about a sample if all that you had was a summary statistic, the sample mean ($\bar x$)

## Example 1

{{< fa coins >}} **A coin toss** gives us 1 degree of freedom. Even with 100 tosses, the fact that there are only two outcomes means that we can recover all of the information about a sample with 1 piece of information (e.g,, n heads, or tails). Only *one* of those values is free to vary!

:::

## Example 2

{{< fa traffic-light >}} **A traffic light** gives us 2 degrees of freedom. We have 3 total outcomes (Red, Yellow, and Green), and we need *two* required pieces of information to resolve the full dataset (and whether there is a cat on the light)

:::

## General formula for the *df*
::: box-6-list
In general, formula to calculate degrees of freedom is: $df = n - p$
:::

[<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> $n$ is equal to the sample size]{.indented-text}

. . . 

[<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> $p$ is equal to the number of parameters (restrictions) that are imposed)]{.indented-text}

<!--
## Practical implications for *df*
::: box-6-list
Dividing by $n$ will [consistently underestimate the variance of a population]{.highlight-tomato}. This, in effect, is because when we divide by $n$, we essentially double dip with one of our pieces of information, given that we already know the sample mean. The effect of this double dipping is ending up with an estimate of the population variance ($s^2$) that will ***always*** be smaller than the true population variance ($\sigma^2$). 
:::

. . . 

:::{.callout-important}
This is the real reason why degrees of freedom is so important. Without accounting for the used up bits of information, we end up with [biased]{.highlight-tomato} estimates of our parameters, and this can lead to inflated error rates in our statistical tests and inference.
:::
-->

## Practical implications for *df*
::: box-6-list
More degrees of freedom means that we have more independent pieces of information with which to estimate our parameter of choice. This leads to more *precise* estimates, and more *powerful* statistical tests.

# Data transformations

## Why transform data?
::: box-6-list
Most of the parametric (i.e., "classical") statistical analyses we conduct depend on an assumption of data that are independent and normally distributed (or have residuals that are normally distributed).
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> Most of the time in ecology, this ain't the case!
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> To meet this assumption, we have a couple of options. The central limit theorem helps us out for any tests involving the mean of $n$ random samples. But sometimes this isn't enough. [Transforming]{.highlight-tomato} our data is another one of the options that we have.
:::

## What transformations do

::: box-6-list
Transformations change the spacing between our data points, but do **not** change the rank order *(e.g., If we transform data points that have the values 4.5 and 10.7, the transformed 10.7 will always be > the transformed 4.5)*
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> Often, we have to try several transformations to best "normalize" our data, but we have a few tried-and-true starting points.
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> Typical transformations include: log, square-root, arcsin (angular), reciprocal, and Box-Cox.
:::

. . . 

:::{.callout-warning}
## Be warned!
There is a lively debate on the practice of transforming data among ecological/statistical practitioners and experts. In general, I caution *against* transforming data unless there is clear precedent in your field and/or a more robust analysis framework (e.g., generalized linear models) cannot be used (which, in my experience, is rare). 
:::

## Examples of transformations: square root

::: box-6-list
The [square root]{.highlight-tomato} transformation ($\sqrt x$) is often used on discrete count variables (e.g., the number of insects in a pitfall trap, number of flowers visited by a bee).
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> Count data is often Poisson distributed, and taking the square root tends to normalize the data (i.e., approximates a normal distribution). 
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> The better way to do this, however, is to use Poisson regression (i.e., a generalized linear model)
:::

## Examples of transformations: logarithmic

::: box-6-list
The [log]{.highlight-tomato} transformation ($log(x)$) is used to normalize very skewed count data (i.e., data that has a long tail).
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> Most of the time, when we say log transformed, we are referrng ot the natural log [$ln(x)$] and NOT the base-10 log [$log_{10}(x)$]
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> Often, we use $log(x+1)$. Why? 
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> Knowing which base you are using is important for back-transforming your data to interpret/plot
:::

## Examples of transformations: angular (arcsin)

::: box-6-list
The [angular]{.highlight-tomato} transformation $arcsin(\sqrt x)$ is used to normalize proportional data between 0 and 1. 
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> This method can have distinct problems if your sample size for each proportion (i.e., the denominator) is not the same for all proportions analyzed (https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1440-1703.2003.00620.x)
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> For analyzing proportion data, there are other methods such as using logistic or beta regression (i.e., a GLM).
:::

## Examples of transformations: reciprocal

::: box-6-list
The [reciprocal]{.highlight-tomato} transformation $1/x$ is used to normalize rate data (e.g., the number of offspring per female) 
:::

## Examples of transformations: Box-Cox

::: box-6-list
The [Box-Cox]{.highlight-tomato} transformation is a power transformation that is done automagically using software that determines the best exponent to transform and normalize data (e.g, $y^0.056493$)
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> This is a lot to do, and now that we have other methods like generalized linear models, I would start with much simpler transformations or more appropriate tools given the type of data you are attempting to model.
:::

## Transformations: which is best?

::: box-6-list
When fitting a model, examining your residual plots can help guide your choice of transformation. These plots are diagnostic of many ways in which we can violate the assumptions of our various modeling approaches. 
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> In all cases, the first choice should be using a model framework more appropriate to your particular data than shoe-horning transformed data into a linear model because that's what you know how to use. 
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> However, there are particular cases where tranforming data is a normal practice and, provided you can support your decision with a clear rationale or citations.
