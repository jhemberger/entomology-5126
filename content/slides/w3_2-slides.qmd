# Hypothesis formulation

## The tail (pun intended) of two hypotheses

::: box-6-list
Let's start by formulating some basic hypotheses around a simple research question. To do that, we will frame out two competing hypotheses:
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> First, write the [null hypothesis]{.highlight-tomato}, $H_0$. This reflects the claim believed to be true, that a system is governed by simple, random variation in the universe.
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> Next, specify the [alternative hypothesis]{.highlight-tomato}, $H_A$. This reflects a departure from $H_0$ that we are designing and experiment or study to be able to detect: that the results of our sampling reflect some factor or influence other than random variation.
:::

## How many tails do we use?

::: box-6-list
In previous stats courses, you likely covered one- and two-tailed statistical tests, which ultimately stem from the structure of our hypotheses.
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> In practice, we almost always will be using *two-tailed* tests, unless we have very specific reasons to suspect a directional hypothesis. 
:::

. . . 

:::{.callout-important}
## Make your intentions clear!
Before conducting any tests (or even looking at your data), decide on whether you will be using a one- vs. two-tailed test of $H_A$.
:::

## Hypothesis formulation example: one-tailed

::: box-6-list
Research question: Are maple trees ***taller than*** oak trees? 
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> $H_0$: There is no difference between the heights of oak and maple trees
:::

$$\mu_{oak} = \mu_{maple}$$

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> $H_A$: Oak trees are taller than maple trees
:::

$$\mu_{oak} > \mu_{maple}$$

## Hypothesis formulation example: two-tailed

::: box-6-list
In practice, we would want to formulate our hypothesis more conservatively -- allowing for any potential differences between our sampled populations:
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> $H_0$: There is no difference between the heights of oak and maple trees
:::

$$\mu_{oak} = \mu_{maple}$$

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> $H_A$: There is a difference in height between oak and maple trees
:::

$$\mu_{oak} ≠ \mu_{maple}$$

## Hypothesis formulation example: two-tailed

::: box-6-list
Research question: We want to know whether patients experience a reduction in coughing when given cough medication {{< fa capsules >}}
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> $H_0$: There is no difference in number of coughs per hour with or without {{< fa capsules >}}
:::

$$\mu_{medicated} = \mu_{unmedicated}$$

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> $H_A$: There is a difference coughs per hour when taking {{< fa capsules >}}
:::

$$\mu_{medicated} ≠ \mu_{unmedicated}$$

## Pair up and formulate!

::: box-6-list
Research question: We want to know whether a particular species of trout prefers riffles or pools (two habitat types) within a stream {{< fa fish-fins >}}

# One-sample *t* tests

## Significance tests: an overview
::: box-6-list
When we go out and perform an experiment and collect data, our sample data are outcomes of a data generating process
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> The data generating process may be described by a probability distribution with certain parameters
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> We begin by considering a random sampole $Y_1, Y_2, Y_3,...Y_n$ of size $n$ from a normal distribution $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ with unknown $\mu$ and known $\sigma^2$. 
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> We then use statistics from the sample data to draw *inference* about the parameters of the probability distribution (e.g., whether the mean is different than our hypothesized value)
:::

## Significance tests: an overview
::: box-6-list
For example, use the sample mean $\bar{Y}$ to draw inference about the population mean $\mu$.
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> There are several ways of pursuing statistical inference. One of them is called [significance testing]{.highlight-tomato}.
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> The main idea of significance tests is to make a yes/no decision about some aspect of a population, based on a single sample. 
:::

## Significance tests: the recipe needed

::: {.incremental}
1. Aspect of a population that is of interest (motivated by research question)
2. Null hypothesis $H_0$
3. Alternative hypothesis $H_A$
4. Test statistic and null distribution
5. Measure evidence against $H_0$
6. Make a decision and interpret in the context of the problem or question
:::

## Test statistic distribtiions

::: {.incremental}
1. $Z$: standard normal distribution - no parameters, mean/variance fixed
2. $t$: one parameter, two-tailed distribution
3. $F$: two-parameter, one-tailed distribution
4. $\chi^2$: one-parameter, one-tailed distribution
:::

## Significance tests for a known $\sigma$
::: box-6-list
In your previous courses/stats work, you probably started with calculating a $Z$ statistic using the formula: 
:::

$$Z = \frac{\bar{Y} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}$$

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> This value was then compared to a $Z$ distribution where you could obtain a p-value. 
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> In ecology (and really, every field), we never know the population variance $\sigma^2$, so we cannot use a $Z$ statistic. 
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> Instead, we estimate $\sigma^2$ using the sample variance $S^2$ and calculate a $t$ statistic instead!
:::

## $t$, $Z$, what's the difference!?
::: box-6-list
Like a $Z$ distribution, a $t$ distribution is defined by a symmetric, bell-shaped curve symmetric about 0
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> But, the $t$ distribution has heavier tails than the $Z$ does
:::

## $t$, $Z$, what's the difference!?

::: {.center-x}

:::

## $t$, $Z$, what's the difference!?
::: box-6-list
Like a $Z$ distribution, a $t$ distribution is defined by a symmetric, bell-shaped curve symmetric about 0
:::

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> But, the $t$ distribution has heavier tails than the $Z$ does
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> The shape of the curve depends on the sample size, $n$. The larger the $n$, the thinner the tails/lesser the spread. In fact, $t_\infty = Z$
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> This shape takes into consideration the [degrees of freedom]{.highlight-tomato} of our sample, effectively penalyzing for our uncertainty of the population variance.
:::

## $t$ significance testing with unknown $\sigma$
::: box-6-list
Consider a random sample $Y_1, Y_2, Y_3,...Y_n$ of size $n$ from a normal distribution $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ with *unknown* $\mu$ and *unknown* $\sigma^2$.
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> Suppose our signifiance test of interest is: 
:::

$$H_0 : \mu = \mu_0$$

. . .

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> We can calculate our test statistic as:
:::

$$T = \frac{\bar{Y} - \mu_0}{S / \sqrt{n}}$$

::: indented-text
where $T_{n-1}$ is a $T$ distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.
:::

## $t$ significance testing with unknown $\sigma$
**Wheat yield example**

::: box-6-list
Six, 1-acre plots are sown with a new variety of wheat. The yields for each plot (in cwt/acre) are: `25, 21, 24, 20, 26, 22` and are from $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$. 
:::

. . .

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> Is there evidence that the population mean yield for this variety of wheat differs from the historical average yield (20 cwt/acre) of the old variety of wheat you were using?
:::

## $t$ significance testing with unknown $\sigma$
**Wheat yield example**

::: box-6-list
Let $\mu$ = population mean yield of this variety of wheat
:::

. . .

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> $H_0 : \mu = 20$
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> $H_A : \mu ≠ 20$
:::

. . .

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> Under $H_0$, the test statistic is: 
:::

$$T = \frac{\bar{Y} - \mu_0}{S / \sqrt{n}} \sim T_{n-1}$$

## $t$ significance testing with unknown $\sigma$
**Wheat yield example**

::: box-6-list
Let's gather and list out our values of interest. 
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> $n = 6, \bar{y} = 23, s = 2.37$
:::


. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> Our observed test statistic is then:
:::

$$T = \frac{\bar{Y} - \mu_0}{S / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{23 - 20}{2.37 / \sqrt{6}} = 3.10$$

::: indented-text
on $df = n - 1 = 5$
:::

::: indented-text
Using our $t$ table or some statistics software, we can calculate that:
:::

$$P(T_5 ≥ 3.10) \approx 0.0138 \times 2 = \textbf{0.0276}$$

## $t$ significance testing with unknown $\sigma$
**Wheat yield example**

::: box-6-list
We can then use this p-value and compare it against a [critical threshold]{.highlight-tomato} of, for example, $\alpha = 0.05$. If our p-value is < 0.05, we can then...
:::

. . . 

:::{.center-x}
*Reject $H_0$ at the $\alpha = 0.05$ level*
:::
</br>

. . . 

:::{.center-x}
or...
:::
</br>

:::{.center-x}
*"The mean yield of our new wheat variety is significantly different than the historical mean yield."*
:::

## Interpreting p-values
::: box-6-list
The p-value can be interpreted as the evidence that we have against $H_0$. The p-value is the probability that we would observe a value equal to or more extreme than our sample mean *if the null hypothesis were true*. 
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> At our value of 0.0276, we would be unlikely to find a mean sample yield of 23 if our null hypothesis of $\mu_0 = 20$ were true. 
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> P-values are nothing more than a guide to making a decision. It allows us to make conclusions about our *statistical hypothesis* of whether there are patterns in our data, but ***not*** whether those patterns are driven by our *scientific hypothesis*
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> It's up to us to draw conclusions about the validity of our scientific hypothesis based on the statistical patterns in the data. The strength of this inference depends on many factors. 
:::

## A general guide to interpreting p-values

::: box-6-list
You'll often read papers and see language describing the strength of statistical support. Assuming a critical threshold of $\alpha = 0.05$, then we can intrepret a p-value: 
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> ≥ 0.10 as no evidence against $H_0$
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> between 0.05 and 0.10 as weak evidence against $H_0$
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> between 0.01 and 0.05 as moderate evidence against $H_0$
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> between 0.001 and 0.01 as strong evidence against $H_0$
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> smaller than 0.001 as very strong evidence against $H_0$
:::

## Assumptions for t-tests

::: {.incremental}
1. Data are independent
2. $Y_1....Y_n$ form a random sample of size $n$ from $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$
3. $\sigma^2$ is unknown (i.e., no assumption about population variance)
4. Any sample size $n$ (i.e., no assumption about sample size)
:::

. . . 

:::{.callout-note}
## Assumptions are not equal!
T-tests are relatively robust to data that are not normally distributed. However, tests are very sensitive to dependence among samples. Our data must be independent!
:::

# Paired, two-sample $t$ test

## Comparing two samples
::: box-6-list
Two-sample comparisons are far more common in ecology and biology than one-sample studies. Some examples include:
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
[{{< fa cow >}}]{.margin-1} Compare milk yields of cows on two different diets
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
[{{< fa tree >}}]{.margin-1} Compare timber volumes of two species of tree in a forest
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
[{{< fa heart >}}]{.margin-1} Compare heart rates of patients before and after a drug treatment
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
[{{< fa dog >}}]{.margin-1} Compare blood flow in two different arteries of dogs
:::

## Paired or unpaired?
::: box-6-list
There are two types of two-sample experiments: paired vs. unpaired two-sample designs
:::

. . .

::: indented-text
[{{< fa people-arrows >}}]{.margin-1} In an independent, two-sample design, there are two treatments (e.g., treatment and placebo), but there is *no direct relationship* between an observation on trt A and an observation on trt B
:::

. . .

::: indented-text
[{{< fa person >}}]{.margin-1} In an paired two-sample design, there are two treatments (e.g., treatment and control) and each observation of treatment A is paired with an observation of treatment B. Related or the same experimental units are used for both treatments (i.e., on the same person, animal, etc.)
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
## Design of experimental is critical!
Choice of paired versus independent two-sample experiment is an important experimental design issue that must be considered!
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
## Choice of analyses is critical!
In addition, it's critical that we always analyze an experiment consistent with the manner in which it was designed.
:::

## Paired or unpaired? An example

::: box-6-list
Let's imagine comparing the heart rates of 10 patients before and after a drug treatment. Which design would you prefer?
:::

. . .

::: indented-text
{{< fa heart-pulse >}}{{< fa person >}} Heart rates of 10 patients before and after a drug treatment (same experimental units)
:::

. . .

::: indented-text
{{< fa heart-pulse >}}{{< fa people-arrows >}} Heart rates of 10 patients before drug treatment and heart rates of another 10 patients after the drug treatment
:::

. . . 

::: box-6-list
We would chose the first design to remove the effect of variability among individuals and increase our precision in estimating the treatment differences (i.e., effect of the medication)
:::

## Paired samples

::: box-6-list
When two samples are paired, you will find that the pairing generally falls into one of two types:
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
{{< fa people-arrows >}} [Matched sample]{.highlight-tomato}: two groups are matched on a particular variable (e.g., twins, spouses)
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
{{< fa person >}}{{< fa arrow-right >}}{{< fa person >}} [Repeated measures]{.highlight-tomato}: a measurement on the same experimental unit before and after
:::

## Paired or unpaired?

::: box-6-list
How would you design experiments around the following research questions? Paired, or unpaired?
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
{{< fa tree >}} How does timber volume vary between two species of tree?
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
{{< fa dog >}} How does the blood flow of two different arteries compare in dogs? 
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
{{< fa cow >}} How does the milk yield of cows vary on two different diets?
:::

## Paired two-sample t-test
**Blood pressure example**

::: box-6-list
A new drug is thought to reduce blood pressure. It is called haemowussilin. An experiment is conducted on 15 middle-aged, male hypertension patients to evaluate the effect of the drug. For each patient, blood pressure is measured, and then after 6 months of the drug treatment, blood pressure is measured again. The question of interest is whether there is any evidence that haemowussilin has an effect on blood pressure.

## Paired two-sample t-test
**Blood pressure example: the method**

::: box-6-list
Recall the general formula of a t-test:
:::

$$T = \frac{\bar{Y} - \mu_0}{S / \sqrt{n}} \sim T_{n-1}$$

. . . 

::: indented-text
How do we get this to fit the experiment? We calculate the *difference*
