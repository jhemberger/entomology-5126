# Hypothesis formulation

## The tail (pun intended) of two hypotheses

::: box-6-list
Let's start by formulating some basic hypotheses around a simple research question. To do that, we will frame out two competing hypotheses:
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> First, write the [null hypothesis]{.highlight-tomato}, $H_0$. This reflects the claim believed to be true, that a system is governed by simple, random variation in the universe.
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> Next, specify the [alternative hypothesis]{.highlight-tomato}, $H_A$. This reflects a departure from $H_0$ that we are designing and experiment or study to be able to detect: that the results of our sampling reflect some factor or influence other than random variation.
:::

## How many tails do we use?

::: box-6-list
In previous stats courses, you likely covered one- and two-tailed statistical tests, which ultimately stem from the structure of our hypotheses.
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> In practice, we almost always will be using *two-tailed* tests, unless we have very specific reasons to suspect a directional hypothesis. 
:::

. . . 

:::{.callout-important}
## Make your intentions clear!
Before conducting any tests (or even looking at your data), decide on whether you will be using a one- vs. two-tailed test of $H_A$.
:::

## Hypothesis formulation example: one-tailed

::: box-6-list
Research question: Are maple trees ***taller than*** oak trees? 
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> $H_0$: There is no difference between the heights of oak and maple trees
:::

$$\mu_{oak} = \mu_{maple}$$

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> $H_A$: Oak trees are taller than maple trees
:::

$$\mu_{oak} > \mu_{maple}$$

## Hypothesis formulation example: two-tailed

::: box-6-list
In practice, we would want to formulate our hypothesis more conservatively -- allowing for any potential differences between our sampled populations:
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> $H_0$: There is no difference between the heights of oak and maple trees
:::

$$\mu_{oak} = \mu_{maple}$$

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> $H_A$: There is a difference in height between oak and maple trees
:::

$$\mu_{oak} ≠ \mu_{maple}$$

## Hypothesis formulation example: two-tailed

::: box-6-list
Research question: We want to know whether patients experience a reduction in coughing when given cough medication {{< fa capsules >}}
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> $H_0$: There is no difference in number of coughs per hour with or without {{< fa capsules >}}
:::

$$\mu_{medicated} = \mu_{unmedicated}$$

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> $H_A$: There is a difference coughs per hour when taking {{< fa capsules >}}
:::

$$\mu_{medicated} ≠ \mu_{unmedicated}$$

## Pair up and formulate!

::: box-6-list
Research question: We want to know whether a particular species of trout prefers riffles or pools (two habitat types) within a stream {{< fa fish-fins >}}

# One-sample *t* tests

## Significance tests: an overview
::: box-6-list
When we go out and perform an experiment and collect data, our sample data are outcomes of a data generating process
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> The data generating process may be described by a probability distribution with certain parameters
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> We begin by considering a random sampole $Y_1, Y_2, Y_3,...Y_n$ of size $n$ from a normal distribution $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ with unknown $\mu$ and known $\sigma^2$. 
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> We then use statistics from the sample data to draw *inference* about the parameters of the probability distribution (e.g., whether the mean is different than our hypothesized value)
:::

## Significance tests: an overview
::: box-6-list
For example, use the sample mean $\bar{Y}$ to draw inference about the population mean $\mu$.
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> There are several ways of pursuing statistical inference. One of them is called [significance testing]{.highlight-tomato}.
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> The main idea of significance tests is to make a yes/no decision about some aspect of a population, based on a single sample. 
:::

## Significance tests: the recipe needed

::: {.incremental}
1. Aspect of a population that is of interest (motivated by research question)
2. Null hypothesis $H_0$
3. Alternative hypothesis $H_A$
4. Test statistic and null distribution
5. Measure evidence against $H_0$
6. Make a decision and interpret in the context of the problem or question
:::

## Test statistic distribtiions

::: {.incremental}
1. $Z$: standard normal distribution - no parameters, mean/variance fixed
2. $t$: one parameter, two-tailed distribution
3. $F$: two-parameter, one-tailed distribution
4. $\chi^2$: one-parameter, one-tailed distribution
:::

## Significance tests for a known $\sigma$
::: box-6-list
In your previous courses/stats work, you probably started with calculating a $Z$ statistic using the formula: 
:::

$$Z = \frac{\bar{Y} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}$$

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> This value was then compared to a $Z$ distribution where you could obtain a p-value. 
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> In ecology (and really, every field), we never know the population variance $\sigma^2$, so we cannot use a $Z$ statistic. 
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> Instead, we estimate $\sigma^2$ using the sample variance $S^2$ and calculate a $t$ statistic instead!
:::

## $t$, $Z$, what's the difference!?
