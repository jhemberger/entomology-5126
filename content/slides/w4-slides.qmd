# Independent, two-sample *t* tests

## Comparing two samples: overview

::: box-6-list
There are two types of two-sample experiments: [paired]{.highlight-tomato} two-sample and [independent]{.highlight-tomato} (unpaired) two-sample

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> The paired two-sample *t* test is essentially a one-sample *t* test of the differences between the pairs
:::

. . . 

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> In an independent two-sample study, there are two treatments, but there is no direct relationship between observations in the two treatments.

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> This means that we can re-arrange the data within each column with no effect on the result of the test.

## Remember!
It's critical that we always analyze an experiment consistent with the manner in which the data were collected.

## Independent two-sample
**Example: fat rats**

::: box-6-list
A vet researcher is interested in comparing the effects of two diets on the weight gains of juvenile rats. A total of 5 rats were assigned to diet type A and another 5 rats were assigned to diet type B. The weight gains (in grams) were recorded for a given period of time. The question of interest is whether there is evidence of a difference in the effect of diet on weight gains.

## Independent two-sample
**Example: fat rats**

| Subject | Diet 1 ($Y_1$) | Diet 2 ($Y_2$) |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| 1       | 37.8           | 12.3           |
| 2       | 27.5           | 14.3           |
| 3       | 41.2           | 19.2           |
| 4       | 26.5           | 4.0            |
| 5       | 28.6           | 25.9           |

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> There is *no* pairing between subjects

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> We can permute (rearrange) the observations within each treatment with no effect on our results

## Independent two-sample
**Example: fat rats**

Recall the formula for a *t*-test:

$$T = \frac{\bar{Y} - \mu_0}{S / \sqrt{n}}$$

How can we get this to fit the experiment?
