# Discrete probability distributions

## Bernoulli random variables
::: box-6-list
Bernoulli random variables describe an outcome of an experiment or event that has only *two* outcomes (commonly referred to as Bernoulli trials)
:::

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> Common applications in ecology are for species presence/absence or for individuals that are alive or dead. 
:::

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> Usually coded as 0/1 in a datasheet, with 1 the positive outcome (alive, present) and 0 the negative (dead, absent) [^1] 
:::

[^1]: Be sure you note this in your metadata!

## Bernoulli random variables
::: box-6-list
We say that a random variable $X$ follows a Bernoulli distribution: $X \sim Bernoulli(p)$ or $P(X) = p$
:::

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> Most familiar example is a coin toss, where $P = 0.50$

## Binomial random variables
::: box-6-list
A binomial random variable is simply a collection of multiple, *independent* Bernoulli trials

## Example: Seed germination experiment

Take three seeds. The seeds are independent (harvested from different plants of the same species). We soak them in water for 24 hours and plant them into a planting mix. After 7 days, we record successful germinations. Let $Y$ be the number of successful germinations. Our sample space is then defined as:

. . . 

| 1st seed | 2nd seed | 3rd seed | Germinations |
|----------|----------|----------|--------------|
| Y        | Y        | Y        | 3            |
| Y        | Y        | N        | 2            |
| Y        | N        | Y        | 2            |
| N        | Y        | Y        | 2            |
| Y        | N        | N        | 1            |
| N        | Y        | N        | 1            |
| N        | N        | Y        | 1            |
| N        | N        | N        | 0            |

## Example: Seed germination experiment

Suppose there is a 50% chance of each seed germinating: 

$$
P(Y) = P(N) = 1/2
$$

Then:
$$ 
P(Y = 3) = P(YYY)\\
         = P(Y)P(Y)P(Y)\\
         = 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8\\
P(Y = 2) = P(YYN \ or \ YNY \ or \ NYY)\\
         = P(YYN) + P(YNY) + P(NYY)\\
         = P(Y)P(Y)P(N) + P(Y)P(N)P(Y) + P(N)P(Y)P(Y)\\
         = 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 3/8
$$

## Example: Seed germination experiment

We can use a line graph to show the probability distribution of $Y$.

. . . 

$$Y \sim Bernoulli(n, p)$$
$$Y \sim Bernoulli(3, 0.5)$$

. . .

::: center-x
``` 
p(y) |
     |
3/8  |     T  T
     |     |  |
1/8  |  T  |  |  T
     |--|--|--|--|--> y
        0  1  2  3
```

## Poisson random variables
::: box-6-list
The [Poisson distribution]{.highlight-tomato} is used to describe the number of occurrences of an event recorded in a sample of fixed area or during a fixed time interval. It's used frequently in spatial and temporal statistics (and for count data!)
:::

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> Examples include number of plants in a quadrat, number of birds visiting a feeder over a period of time, etc.
:::

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> Modeled as $X \sim Poisson(\lambda)$
:::

::: indented-text
<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up fa-rotate-90"></i> $\lambda$, the "intensity", is the average value of the number of occurrences of the event in each sample. Critical in spatial point processes!
