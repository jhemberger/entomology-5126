Here, you'll find the virtual companion to all of our hands-on labs for the semester. These will be the same as your physical hand-outs, but I know many folks prefer to have them up on their screens as they work through the activities. 

The purpose of these labs is to practice applying the topics that we discuss in lecture using real-world examples and data. The associated data files for each lab are linked in the `Frontmatter` section atop each page (all the files are also located [here](link here)). Over the semester, we'll explore some of the frustrations and challenges of working with bio/ecological data (of which there are many!), but together we'll conquer them, setting y'all up for success in analyzing, interpreting, and sharing your own data.

As a reminder, each of the 13 labs will have an assignment/report that will be evaluated. The first three periods will be devoted to a primer of using R/RStudio for managing, wrangling, and interpreting data, and the reports associated with these will receive feedback but will not be included in the course grade. The remaining 10 lab assignments/reports will be graded and count toward 40% of total course grade (4% per report). There will also be a lab final worth 15% of the total course grade. In this, students will be given a real data set to analyze and develop a report for during the last lab period.
