I’m not opposed to using these tools in a variety of circumstances, and I use ChatGPT for a variety of tasks to provide a quick review of my own work. These tools are phenomenal resources for coding when you already know what you are doing. Using LLMs requires careful skill, attention, practice, and they tend to be useful only in specific limited cases.\nUsing ChatGPT to write all of your code will not help you learn how to master R or understand the statistical concepts that we are learning in this class. What these models do is essentially amalgamate all of the publicly-available code on GitHub and spit out a plausible looking answer. This is otherwise known as bullshitting. Sure, bullshitting can sometimes get you part of, or, in rare instances, all the way to the right answer. But more often than not, the code it spits out will contain components that are outright wrong or have stuff you don’t need. These models don’t care if the “answer” provided is wrong or right (nor can the models actually know). It doesn’t care if your code runs or not. It just cares that the crap it spits back at you looks plausible. A hilarious, and slightly terrifying example of this comes from Andrew Heiss:\n\n“A good analogy for this is with recipes. ChatGPT is really confident at spitting out plausible-looking recipes. A few months ago, for fun, I asked it to give me a cookie recipe. I got back something with flour, eggs, sugar, and all other standard-looking ingredients, but it also said to include 3/4 cup of baking powder. That’s wild and obviously wrong, but I only knew that because I’ve made cookies before. I’ve seen other AI-generated recipes that call for a cup of horseradish in brownies or 21 pounds of cabbage for a pork dish. In May 2024, Google’s AI recommended adding glue to pizza sauce to stop the cheese from sliding off. Again, to people who have cooked before, these are all obviously wrong (and dangerous in the case of the glue!), but to a complete beginner, these look like plausible instructions.”\n\nThe purpose of this course is to outfit y’all with the concepts and tools needed to accurately and honestly portray the results of hard-won data that we use to understand the way the world works so that we can be better stewards and citizens of our shared planet. I want y’all to succeed in this. I don’t want to read a bunch of bullshit generated by an LLM. It’s not useful to you. It’s not useful to me. It’s a waste of time.\nAll that said, I’m not going to play Sherlock and try and guess whether or not what you’re turning in is AI-generated. As I mentioned above, there are legitimate and good use-cases for LLMs in the work that we do such as helping debug some code, interpreting an error message that you don’t understand, or helping translate what individual lines of code may be doing if you can’t understand from the documentation. However, there’s a fairly good chance that I will notice if what you’re turning in came from a LMM. There are tells in the way machines write code versus the way most humans do. While this may not impact your grade, it will impact your learning. And it will make me sad. Please don’t make me sad."

The first three periods will be devoted to a primer of using R/RStudio for managing, wrangling, and interpreting data, and the reports associated with these will receive feedback but will not be included in the course grade. The remaining 10 lab assignments/reports will be graded and count toward 40% of total course grade (4% per report). There will also be a lab final worth 15% of the total course grade. In this, students will be given a real data set to analyze and develop a report for during the last lab period.\nLab reports will be due one week following the lab exercise at the beginning of the lab. Please upload these into Canvas. Please don’t email these to me! There’s no grade penalty for late submissions of lab reports. That said, I highly recommend staying caught up.

I got back something with flour, eggs, sugar, and all other standard-looking ingredients, but it also said to include 3/4 cup of baking powder. That’s wild and obviously wrong, but I only knew that because I’ve made cookies before. I’ve seen other AI-generated recipes that call for a cup of horseradish in brownies or 21 pounds of cabbage for a pork dish. In May 2024, Google’s AI recommended adding glue to pizza sauce to stop the cheese from sliding off. Again, to people who have cooked before, these are all obviously wrong (and dangerous in the case of the glue!), but to a complete beginner, these look like plausible instructions.”\n\nThe purpose of this course is to outfit y’all with the concepts and tools needed to accurately and honestly portray the results of hard-won data that we use to understand the way the world works so that we can be better stewards and citizens of our shared planet. I want y’all to succeed in this. I don’t want to read a bunch of bullshit generated by an LLM. It’s not useful to you. It’s not useful to me. It’s a waste of time.\nAll that said, I’m not going to play Sherlock and try and guess whether or not what you’re turning in is AI-generated. As I mentioned above, there are legitimate and good use-cases for LLMs in the work that we do such as helping debug some code, interpreting an error message that you don’t understand, or helping translate what individual lines of code may be doing if you can’t understand from the documentation. However, there’s a fairly good chance that I will notice if what you’re turning in came from a LMM. There are tells in the way machines write code versus the way most humans do. While this may not impact your grade, it will impact your learning. And it will make me sad. Please don’t make me sad.\n\n\nPhones and electronic devices\nObviously we’ll need access to computers for this course, and taking notes during lectures on your computers is fine. However, I would suggest taking real, physical notes given the abundance of research that links this to improved comprehension and learning outcomes. As for cell phone use, please silence them and put them in a bag.\n\n\nStudent conduct\nThe University seeks an environment that promotes academic achievement and integrity, that is protective of free inquiry, and that serves the educational mission of the University. Similarly, the University seeks a community that is free from violence, threats, and intimidation; that is respectful of the rights, opportunities, and welfare of students, faculty, staff, and guests of the University; and that does not threaten the physical or mental health or safety of members of the University community. As a student at the University you are expected to adhere to the Student Conduct Code as approved by the Board of Regents. The Student Conduct Code can be found in the UMN Policy Library: https://regents.umn.edu/policy/allboard-of-regents.\n\n\nAcademic integrity\nAcademic integrity is essential to a positive teaching and learning environment. All students enrolled in University courses are expected to complete coursework responsibilities with fairness and honesty. The University Student Code of Conduct defines scholastic dishonesty as:\n\n”…submission of false records of academic achievement; cheating on assignments or examinations; plagiarizing; altering, forging, or misusing a University academic record; taking, acquiring, or using test materials without faculty permission; acting alone or in cooperation with another to falsify records or to obtain dishonestly grades, honors, awards, or professional endorsement.”\n\nRarely - especially among upper division courses - have I found this to be a problem. I encourage and expect students to work together on laboratory assignments; in real practice, you will collaborate or discuss with colleagues the best analytical route to choose. However, the work you submit must be your own. Plagiarism (from classmates or the internet), cheating during tests or exams, or misrepresenting the nature of your involvement in any assigned work may result in disciplinary action, including, but not limited to, a penalty up to and including an “F” or “N” for the course.\n\n\nStudent accommodations\nOccasionally, the need arises to employ different testing techniques in assessing student mastery of the subject matter. Determining appropriate disability accommodations is a collaborative process. You as a student must register with Disability Services and provide documentation of your disability; I will then work with Disability Services to determine appropriate accommodations. See http://disability.umn.edu.\n\n\nStress management\nWe live in continually unprecedented times. On top of all the external stressors in our lives, strained relationships, anxiety, depression, substance addiction problems, and more can impede learning, reduce your ability to participate in daily activities, and reduce your academic performance (in addition to just making your life more difficult and miserable!). Please realize that you are not alone and that a broad range of confidential mental health services are available on campus to assist you. Reaching out for help is challenging – but it is a smart and courageous thing to do. http://www.mentalhealth.umn.edu"
