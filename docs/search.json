Despite this, I still encourage you to attend to (1) make sure your memory serves and (2) get to know your fellow students (i.e., collaborators). We’ll also be re-enforcing the expectations for future lab assignments.\nLab: Because campus does not have a computer lab available for our class, please bring your own laptop with R and RStudio installed to class. If you don’t have access to one, please let me know and I’ll facilitate furnishing one for you! The lab session each week will emphasize hands-on analytical skills and statistical methods relevant to the week’s lecture content.

These will include concepts covered in the lectures and may include relevant examples or reference to skills practiced in the labs, as well.\nLab: There are a total of 13 labs, each with a lab assignment/report that will be evaluated. The first three periods will be devoted to a primer of using R/RStudio for managing, wrangling, and interpreting data, and the reports associated with these will receive feedback but will not be included in the course grade. The remaining 10 lab assignments/reports will be graded and count toward 40% of total course grade (4% per report). There will also be a lab final worth 15% of the total course grade. In this, students will be given a real data set to analyze and develop a report for during the last lab period.\nLab reports will be due one week following the lab exercise at the beginning of the lab. Please upload these into Canvas. Please don’t email these to me! There’s no grade penalty for late submissions of lab reports. That said, I highly recommend staying caught up. The level of feedback I’m able to give will decline exponentially with each passing day, so that’s effectively the only punishment.\nAt the end of the course, letter grades will be assigned to the quantitative point totals from student performance in the class. Pretty standard stuff here!\nPoint Breakdown Assignment Points Percent Lab reports (10 × 16) 160 40% Lab final 60 15% Lecture midterm 80 20% Lecture final 100 25% Total 400 100%\nFinal Grade Breakdown Grade Range Grade Range A 93–100% C 73–76% A− 90–92% C− 70–72% B+ 87–89% D+ 67–69% B 83–86% D 63–66% B− 80–82% D− 60–62% C+ 77–79% F &lt; 60%\nAdjustments to final grades based on class participation or instructional interaction demonstrating mastery may be made on a case-by-case basis.

All of these materials will be posted on the course website. These are for reference only and serve as more in-depth treatments of some of the course material.\n\n\nSoftware\nThe purpose of this class is to teach concepts over software - - this ensures that after this course, students will be able to implement the methods covered in their software of choice. That said, we need to choose some computational tool to do our work, so we will be using R and its integrated development environment, RStudio, in this course. R is the most widely used language and statistical software in the life sciences. It’s available on all major operating systems and is 100% free and open-source ensuring that students will retain access to the toolkits developed in this course long after the semester ends. We’ll cover all of the basics of installing and using R to load, manipulate, and visualize data, assuming that folks may have some familiarity with R, but with enough detail that novices will be able to pick up the necessary skills as well. However, if you’d like to get a head start on learning R, some great, free online resources are included on the course website."

    "text": "Policies\n\nAttendance\nAttendance in lectures and labs is strongly encouraged. Can you learn these skills on your own? Sure. But you’ll get a better outcome and enjoy the process a whole lot more by doing it with your friends and colleagues! This is especially the case when learning a new skillset like R - - being able to quickly bounce a question off of someone IRL is always preferable to spending hours trawling StackExchange for an answer. Please give me a heads-up if you will be away for a week or more. If you will miss any assessment activity, it is your responsibility to contact me in advance so suitable arrangements can be made for a make-up exercise given valid circumstances (time-sensitive field work, bereavement, medical, etc.). Absence of a good faith attempt to let me know of your anticipated or unexpected absence may result in a grade of zero for missed assessments.\n\n\nAI, LLMs, and Bullshit\nI highly recommend NOT using ChatGPT or other large language models (aka LLMs) in this (or any…) class.\nThese tools, while highly functional and time-saving in certain situations, are at direct odds with the practice of learning and developing competence in concepts and skills - be they coding, writing, or other artistic pursuits. I’m not opposed to using these tools in a variety of circumstances, and I use ChatGPT for a variety of tasks to provide a quick review of my own work. These tools are phenomenal resources for coding when you already know what you are doing. Using LLMs requires careful skill, attention, practice, and they tend to be useful only in specific limited cases.\nUsing ChatGPT to write all of your code will not help you learn how to master R or understand the statistical concepts that we are learning in this class. What these models do is essentially amalgamate all of the publicly-available code on GitHub and spit out a plausible looking answer. This is otherwise known as bullshitting. Sure, bullshitting can sometimes get you part of, or, in rare instances, all the way to the right answer. But more often than not, the code it spits out will contain components that are outright wrong or have stuff you don’t need. These models don’t care if the “answer” provided is wrong or right (nor can the models actually know). It doesn’t care if your code runs or not. It just cares that the crap it spits back at you looks plausible. A hilarious, and slightly terrifying example of this comes from Andrew Heiss:\n\n“A good analogy for this is with recipes. ChatGPT is really confident at spitting out plausible-looking recipes. A few months ago, for fun, I asked it to give me a cookie recipe. I got back something with flour, eggs, sugar, and all other standard-looking ingredients, but it also said to include 3/4 cup of baking powder. That’s wild and obviously wrong, but I only knew that because I’ve made cookies before. I’ve seen other AI-generated recipes that call for a cup of horseradish in brownies or 21 pounds of cabbage for a pork dish. In May 2024, Google’s AI recommended adding glue to pizza sauce to stop the cheese from sliding off. Again, to people who have cooked before, these are all obviously wrong (and dangerous in the case of the glue!), but to a complete beginner, these look like plausible instructions.”\n\nThe purpose of this course is to outfit y’all with the concepts and tools needed to accurately and honestly portray the results of hard-won data that we use to understand the way the world works so that we can be better stewards and citizens of our shared planet. I want y’all to succeed in this. I don’t want to read a bunch of bullshit generated by an LLM. It’s not useful to you. It’s not useful to me. It’s a waste of time.\nAll that said, I’m not going to play Sherlock and try and guess whether or not what you’re turning in is AI-generated. As I mentioned above, there are legitimate and good use-cases for LLMs in the work that we do such as helping debug some code, interpreting an error message that you don’t understand, or helping translate what individual lines of code may be doing if you can’t understand from the documentation. However, there’s a fairly good chance that I will notice if what you’re turning in came from a LMM. There are tells in the way machines write code versus the way most humans do. While this may not impact your grade, it will impact your learning. And it will make me sad. Please don’t make me sad.\n\n\nPhones and electronic devices\nObviously we’ll need access to computers for this course, and taking notes during lectures on your computers is fine. However, I would suggest taking real, physical notes given the abundance of research that links this to improved comprehension and learning outcomes. As for cell phone use, please silence them and put them in a bag.\n\n\nStudent conduct\nThe University seeks an environment that promotes academic achievement and integrity, that is protective of free inquiry, and that serves the educational mission of the University. Similarly, the University seeks a community that is free from violence, threats, and intimidation; that is respectful of the rights, opportunities, and welfare of students, faculty, staff, and guests of the University; and that does not threaten the physical or mental health or safety of members of the University community. As a student at the University you are expected to adhere to the Student Conduct Code as approved by the Board of Regents. The Student Conduct Code can be found in the UMN Policy Library: https://regents.umn.edu/policy/allboard-of-regents.\n\n\nAcademic integrity\nAcademic integrity is essential to a positive teaching and learning environment. All students enrolled in University courses are expected to complete coursework responsibilities with fairness and honesty. The University Student Code of Conduct defines scholastic dishonesty as:\n\n”…submission of false records of academic achievement; cheating on assignments or examinations; plagiarizing; altering, forging, or misusing a University academic record; taking, acquiring, or using test materials without faculty permission; acting alone or in cooperation with another to falsify records or to obtain dishonestly grades, honors, awards, or professional endorsement.”\n\nRarely - especially among upper division courses - have I found this to be a problem. I encourage and expect students to work together on laboratory assignments; in real practice, you will collaborate or discuss with colleagues the best analytical route to choose. However, the work you submit must be your own. Plagiarism (from classmates or the internet), cheating during tests or exams, or misrepresenting the nature of your involvement in any assigned work may result in disciplinary action, including, but not limited to, a penalty up to and including an “F” or “N” for the course.\n\n\nStudent accommodations\nOccasionally, the need arises to employ different testing techniques in assessing student mastery of the subject matter. Determining appropriate disability accommodations is a collaborative process. You as a student must register with Disability Services and provide documentation of your disability; I will then work with Disability Services to determine appropriate accommodations. See http://disability.umn.edu.\n\n\nStress management\nWe live in continually unprecedented times. On top of all the external stressors in our lives, strained relationships, anxiety, depression, substance addiction problems, and more can impede learning, reduce your ability to participate in daily activities, and reduce your academic performance (in addition to just making your life more difficult and miserable!). Please realize that you are not alone and that a broad range of confidential mental health services are available on campus to assist you. Reaching out for help is challenging – but it is a smart and courageous thing to do. http://www.mentalhealth.umn.edu"

One area of time series analysis includes “repeated measures” analyses. As you might expect, it involves taking repeated measures on an experimental subject (whether that be a plant, animal, human, etc…). For example, you might take repeated measurements on a person to examine how fast a particular drug is cleared from the body. In statistics, such studies are commonly called “longitudinal studies” but should not be confused with any spatial analyses.\nMixed effects models are useful for repeated measures studies because they can accommodate the temporal dependence of multiple observations on each experimental subject.",

However, the method in which coefficient estimates are obtained has changed. Now, we use maximum likelihood methods, not ordinary least squares. Just a different mathematical technique, that’s all.\nWithout ordinary least squares, we have lost our ability to calculate \\(R^2\\) values. They simply do not exist. Instead we have something known as information criteria: other measures of fit of a statistical model.\nThe most common information criterion is Akaike’s Information Criterion, originally proposed by Hirotugu Akaike, defined as\n\\[AIC = -2\\ln(L)+2k\\]\nwhere \\(2k\\) is twice the number of parameters (i.e., a penalty for adding more variables to improve the model fit, analagous to \\(R^2_{adj}\\)) and \\(L\\) is the maximized value of the likelihood function for the estimated model. We will not cover this in detail. Similarly, we will not cover other types of information criteria (AICc, BIC, DIC, etc.) but they are all variations on the theme.\nHere are some things you should remember about AIC values and model selection:\n\nAIC values do not give you a test of the model in terms of hypothesis testing. Rather, information criteria are just a tool for model selection (comparing between models).\nAIC values vary. They are not bounded between 0 and 1 like an \\(R^2\\) value.\nThe lower the number, the better the model fit, but you can only compare models with the same response variable and the same data set. For example, you can compare \\(y \\sim x\\) vs. \\(y \\sim w\\) but you cannot compare \\(y \\sim x\\) vs. \\(sqrt(y) \\sim x\\)\nIf your model has random effects, you can only compare models with different nested random effects if each model has the same fixed effects structure.

    "text": "Nesting random effects\nSome experimental designs incorporate nesting. In the social sciences, you may see the term ‘multilevel models.’’ We know that a good rule for experimental analysis is to always analyze an experiment consistent with the manner in which it was designed.\nPretend that you select three regions, and then four plots within each of those regions, before you sample the height (\\(y\\)) and diameter (\\(x\\)) of 10 trees each. Your analysis should reflect the regional and plot-within-region variation. Nesting random effects is done with the forward slash in R:\n\n&gt; fm1 &lt;- lme(y ~ diameter, data=mydata, random = ~ 1 | region/plot)\nWe are now presented with some philosophical choices. You could just leave the analysis at that. Another prevalent school of thought encourages statistical models to be as simple as possible. For example, if the plot-to-plot variation in a site is not significant, perhaps we can just set that aside. Hence, we frequently test to see if we can remove the lowest level of nesting. We may start by analysing the experiment consistent with the manner in which it was designed, but then see if we can make it simpler.\nTo test whether we can remove the lowest level of nesting, we fit both models and compare them using a likelihood ratio test. (This is analagous to the additional sums of squares tests that I showed in class).\n&gt; fm1 &lt;- lme(y ~ diameter, data=mydata, random = ~ 1 | region)\n&gt; fm2 &lt;- lme(y ~ diameter, data=mydata, random = ~ 1 | region/plot)\n&gt; anova(fm1, fm2)\nNote that both models have the same response variable and the same fixed effects structure. The output from the anova() command specifying both models separted by a comma will produce a likelihood ratio test with an associated \\(p\\)-value. If the \\(p\\)-value is less than 0.05, one model is statistically better than the other. In that case, choose the model with the lowest AIC value.\nIt is not terribly common to have nesting in time series data, but it can happen (e.g., taking repeated height (\\(y\\)) measurements through time (\\(x\\)) for the trees that are nested in different sites, as above). We do not have nesting in today’s lab.",

What I might do is start with the most consistent model with my experimental design, find the best fixed-effects structure, and then simplify the random effects. Other times, I might start with a model without any random effects at all, find an OK model, and then put the random effects back in to see if things still work.

Once you have a good model, to get detailed information on model coefficients, use the summary() command.\nThe summary will appear similar to tables that you have seen before, with a few twists. First, you will see summary statistics for AIC, BIC, and the log likelihood.\nNext, you will see a listing of random effects. Random effects are often reported when you specify a model, but not in the resulting equation of the line (see last question today).\nLet’s say you were working with blood pressure readings on different people, perhaps in different treatment groups. You might see this output from a model \\(y \\sim time + trt\\) with a random effect for person:\nRandom effects:\n Formula: ~1 | person\n        (Intercept) Residual\nStdDev:    8.917896 5.032072\nThis would specify that the resulting expected blood pressure value \\(\\hat{y}\\) (for a given timepoint and treatment group) could be adjusted at random up or down by a standard deviation of 8.9 to account for variability among people. Then, on top of that, there is another random adjustment of \\(\\pm\\)5.03 standard deviations for all noise left over (so, if blood pressure reading is the experimental unit, variation among readings within each person).\nFinally, you will see a fixed effects table - essentially your model summary. (Ignore the table of intraclass correlations below that during today’s lab). You will also see information on the distribution of residuals, which can be used (along with a graphical residual plot!) to determine if the assumptions of your model are being met.",

    "text": "Time Series\nAnalysis of time series is typically taught as a one-semester course, providing exposure to autocorrelation functions, partial autocorrelation functions, detrending data, spectral approaches, moving average (MA), autoregressive moving average (ARMA), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and more. Today we will play with autoregressive (AR) models. This is where most time series courses begin.\n\n\nAutoregressive models\nTo this point in the course, we have been doing variations on a theme of explaining some continuous response variable \\(y\\) by some response variable \\(x\\). \\[y \\sim x\\] We have learned that \\(x\\) can be continuous (i.e., regression) or a factor (i.e., ANOVA). We can even add more continuous variables (i.e., multiple regression) and mix continuous variables and factors (i.e., ANCOVA).\nNow we’re going to put in a twist. Auto of course means self, so autoregression is regressing a variable on itself. \\[y \\sim y\\] Huh?\nWell, yeah, something like that. Actually, the covariate is the variable shifted backwards in time (lags, denoted as \\(k\\)). The general form of an AR(\\(k\\)) model can be written:\n\\[y_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1y_{t-1} + \\beta_2y_{t-2} + \\ldots + \\beta_ky_{t-k} + \\epsilon_i\\]\nwhere \\(y\\) is the variable of interest, \\(t\\) denotes time, \\(k\\) the time lags (i.e., what happened today depended on what happened yesterday, and perhaps two days ago, and\\(\\ldots\\)), and we assume the remaining errors \\(\\epsilon_i\\)~\\(N(0,\\sigma^2)\\).\nNow, there are alternate ways to parameterize an autoregressive model. Although we will deal with modeling the temporal dependence in the mean term in today’s lab, another common parameterization includes modeling the temporal autocorrelation in the error term. Below, I have written a “first-order autoregressive model”, or AR(1), where the principal dependence structure is related to a single-step time lag. For now, this is FYI only, although we will return to this concept as we work with lattice and areal data in spatial statistics in a few weeks.\n\\[y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x + e_i\\] where\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\ne_i &=& \\rho e_{i-1} + u_i,\\quad i=1,2,\\cdots,n,\\\\\ne_0 &\\sim& N\\left(0, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{1-\\rho^2}\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nand we assume \\(u_i\\sim {\\rm iid} N(0,\\sigma^2)\\) and \\(0&lt;\\rho&lt;1\\). For example, \\(e_{10} = \\rho e_{9} + u_{10}\\).\nA property of an AR(1) model is that \\[cor(e_i, e_j) = \\rho^{|i-j|},\\] where \\(0&lt;\\rho&lt;1\\).\nTwo things to note from the above structure:\n\nIf \\(\\rho\\) is close to 0, the temporal correlation is small.\nIf two time points \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) are far apart, the temporal correlation is small.\n\nIf you have a hard time understanding such notation for now, that’s OK; it will become more clear by Lab 12. In this lab, we’ll focus on modeling the temporal autocorrelation in the mean term.\n\n\nToday’s Data\nToday’s data is stored in Lab8data2024.txt. It is a tab-delimited text file with appropriate headers. The data are the daily temperatures at the Minneapolis St. Paul airport (weather station KMSP) from 01 January through 13 March 2024. They were obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration https://www.weather.gov/mpx/mspclimate on March 14, 2024. There are five columns: Month, Day, Julian Day, Max, and Min (in degrees Farenheit). The goal of today’s lab is to describe the daily temperatures with an appropriate model.\n\n\nAssignment\n\nLoad the data, check a summary, and, of course, graph it. Let’s work with the maximum daily temperature. Plot maximum daily temperature vs. Julian day.\n&gt; plot(Max\\(\\sim\\)Julian, data=mydata)\nThis graph indicates to me that spring is coming! It appears that the daily maximum temperature increases with the passage of time since January the 1st, as we might expect. It looks like a rising trend, so fit a straight line to the data:\n&gt; fm1 &lt;- lm(Max\\(\\sim\\)Julian, data)\n&gt; summary(fm1)\nYou can plot the fitted line on top of the original plot like this:\n&gt; lines(fitted.values(fm1))\nHmm. The straight line trend looks like it fits pretty well, but I should of course take a look at the residual plot.\n&gt; plot(residuals(fm1)\\(\\sim\\)fitted.values(fm1))\nThe spread around zero is beautiful, with roughly equal variance across the plot from residuals less than 20 vs. greater than 20. I do not think I need a transformation of the response variable. (If you want to push yourself (not for homework): If you were working with minimum temperature data and wanted to use a transformation, could you use a square root transformation on these data? Why or why not? How might you proceed?).\nSince this is a lab focused primarily on assumption \\(\\#2\\) of linear models (i.e., errors are independent!), we’ll just pretend the assumption of equal variance is good enough for now.\nNow let’s explore the thorny issue of autocorrelation. Have I mentioned that these are real data?\nThe current model examines daily maximum temperature as a function of time. Time is placed in the ‘mean’ part of the model. Sometimes, simply specifying the temporal variable in the mean part of the model will explain away all temporal autocorrelation. Our goal, when working with temporal data, is to end up with uncorrelated errors (model assumption #2: errors are independent!).\nWe will use a Durbin-Watson test to check model residuals for temporal autocorrelation. It’s very simple.\nLoad the car package written by John Fox, a Professor Emeritus in the Department of Sociology at McMaster University. Prof. Fox had along and fruitful career developing regression methods in statistics. His package (“Companion to Applied Regression”) contains the necessary function.\n&gt; durbinWatsonTest(fm1)\nThis function tests the residuals of a model (in this case, fm1). In the output, you will see four things: a lag term (1 indicates the previous time step), an autocorrelation value, a D-W statistic testing whether that autocorrelation estimate is significantly different from zero (i.e., uncorrelated!), and a \\(P\\)-value. A significant \\(P\\)-value indicates that there IS significant autocorrelation remaining in the residuals of the model.\nTest the residuals for autocorrelation. What is the outcome? (Don’t read the next sentence while you answer this question).\nBummer. (Hey! I told you not to read this sentence!) Well, I thought the graph and the model looked ok, even if the \\(R^2\\) wasn’t very high (\\(F_{1,71}=39.54; P&lt;0.0001; R^2=0.358\\)). But now we know that modeling time (as Julian date) in the mean term did not quite take care of the autocorrelation in the data. (Literature terminology: when you place a variable in the mean term that successfully explains the autocorrelation, this is sometimes known as whitening the trend).\nLet’s change approaches to see if we can come up with a good explanation of daily maximum temperature, and still come up with uncorrelated errors. We will try an autoregressive model. With this model, we only deal with the \\(y\\) variable and derivations of itself (although you could add other variables, I suppose).\nIn constructing an autoregressive model, we first check the autocorrelation function:\n&gt; acf(data$Max)\nThe autocorrelation function measures the correlation of the series with itself lagged \\(k\\) time steps. You will see a correlation scale on the \\(y\\) axis ranging between \\(+1\\) and \\(-1\\). On the \\(x\\) axis, you will note integers for increasing previous time steps, or lags. So, for example, if you were to see a vertical line corresponding to \\(+0.5\\) at \\(k=3\\), that would indicate that the time series at time \\(t\\) (often denoted \\(y_t\\)) appears to be positively correlated with a copy of itself at \\(y_{t-3}\\) (three steps previous). This implementation of the function even includes some nifty blue dotted lines that shows statistical significance of the correlation (anything within the blue lines is statistically indistinguishable from zero).\nWhy does the autocorrelation at lag \\(k=0\\) equal one?\nThe acf() function shows us the autocorrelation through time. There are, of course, many different ways that autocorrelation can propogate through time. For instance, if everything looks relatively similar to the last previously observed time, we might expect that the correlation would “stick around” for \\(2,3,4\\ldots\\) time steps until it decays and disappears. This behaviour characterizes a very popular class of autoregressive models termed AR(1), or first order autoregressive. (Please note: This is also what some SAS software users call ‘repeated measures.’ But you can see that ‘repeated measures’ is something measured repeatedly, and the temporal dependence in the data is a separate issue! The autocorrelation structure need not be first order, even though it is a very frequent phenomenon. Do not confound measuring something repeatedly with specifying one type of autocorrelation).\nFor first-order autoregressive models, the autocorrelation \\(\\rho\\) decays exponentially \\(\\rho^k\\) at the \\(k^{th}\\) lag. So, if the autocorrelation at lag 1 is 0.4, we might expect that it would decay to \\(0.4^2=0.16\\) and \\(0.4^3=0.064\\) at time lags 2 and 3 (and so on). If you plot the autocorrelation function and see a gentle positive decay through several time lags, you are probably staring at first order autocorrelation.\nWe have all heard arguments about how unreliable weather forecasts are. From looking at your acf() graph, in a general sense, from only having a two and a half month list of daily temperatures, what is the farthest out in time that you could make a statistically relevant guesstimate of that day’s maximum temperature?\nOf course, there are many different orders of autocorrelation. Many time series of organisms that display oscillating population dynamics show second order autocorrelation, for example.\nWhile the acf() function provides some strong diagnostic hints for determining order, a helpful way to diagnose order is to examine the partial autocorrlelation function, pacf(). A partial autocorrelation function displays the correlation left at time lag \\(k\\) after removing autocorrelation with an AR(\\(k-1\\)) model. So, for example, if you have an AR(1) model, you would expect the autocorrelation at \\(k=2\\) to be non-significant once you account for “what happened yesterday” (\\(k=1\\)).\nSome students find it difficult to grasp the difference between the acf() and pacf() functions. To review, you can think of the above acf() and pacf()functions as a two step process that works in tandem. First, is there autocorrelation? What does it look like? (Does it decay slowly like something contagious passed down from day to day, does it bounce back and forth so an immediate time step looks diametrically opposite the previous one, etc.) Second, what is the order of the autocorrelation? How far back does the time series look like itself? (These questions are rhetorical - do not answer them for the homework). Put another way, the acf() can describe the pattern. The pacf() can tell you what is causing that pattern.\nPlot the partial autocorrelation function:\n&gt; pacf(data$Max)\nThe dashed blue lines indicate significance values. Whoa! If you are looking at the same chart I was, I didn’t expect to see that. It’s always tempting as an instructor to change a few points and “fix” the assignment - but then you wouldn’t really be getting an education, would you? There are a couple of curiosities in this graph.\nDescribe for me exactly what this chart is telling you about trends in the data, and, in a general sense, what you think of that information.\nOnce we know the order, we can lag the data and regress \\(y_t\\) on \\(y_{t-k}\\). Create two new columns with the maximum temperature lagged one day and then two days. Be careful when doing this! It’s easy to lag the data in the wrong direction. You can either do this in a spreadsheet, or in R:\n&gt; data$MaxLag1 &lt;- c(NA, data[1:(nrow(data)-1), \"Max\"])\n&gt; data$MaxLag2 &lt;- c(NA, NA, data[1:(nrow(data)-2), \"Max\"])\n&gt; data[1:5,] # Check the first five rows\nNotice that the first \\(k\\) observations are always lost, so when doing this type of time series analysis, there is a limit to how many lags you can reasonably study, especially with a very short data series. While there might be statistical rationale from the pacf() graph to explore a time lag more than five or seven days out, I would not do that here.\nPlot the Max temperature against its lag variable of \\(k=1\\). By eye, describe what the correlation looks like (if any).\nRegress the maximum temperature on it’s \\(k=1\\) lag (in other words, maximum temperature as a function of the temperature the day before). If you left the missing value for the first observation’s lag in the data set, you will see a new message that appears on a line between the Residual standard error and the Multiple R-squared lines in the summary() command.\nComment on the \\(R^2\\) and the apparent overall significance of the model. Remember, the inference from some of the test statistics might be slightly off if there is significant autocorrelation, so view the stats with some caution. Examine the residual plot, and \\(\\ldots\\)\nCheck the D-W statistic. Is there any temporal autocorrelation left after accounting for \\(y_{t-1}\\)? Is an AR1 time series model for maximum temperature necessary?\nIf you want to see your work graphed, with the \\(\\hat{y}_t\\):\n&gt; plot(Max\\(\\sim\\)Julian, data)\n&gt; lines(fitted.values(yourAR1model))\nDo note that the equation predicting the daily maximum temperature is not the same as the plot function, which is just graphing two variables for you; i.e., your final model is not\n\\[temperature = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1day\\]\nIt can be kind of confusing when you are graphing a model that uses a variable not on the \\(x\\)-axis per se.\nNow, find and report a good model (time series or not) for minimum daily temperature. When reporting a model, be sure to report the equation of the line and define the variables and their units. For an example of how to report model summary statistics, see question #3. Have fun!",

    "text": "Installing packages\nLike ecology, there are many subdisciplines of statistics. R comes as a ‘base’ package. Depending on what you want to do, this may be sufficient. Often, however, you will need to install a contributed addition to do more specialized tasks, like spatial or temporal analyses. These additions are called “packages.” Think of statistics as creating a recipe to analyze your data, where R is an oven to bake your creation. Packages, then, are extra features you can add to the oven (e.g., air fryer, stainless steel griddle, extra burner, etc.) if your recipe needs it. You can either use the “Load package” command from the “Packages” menu, or you can simply type\nlibrary(whateverpackageyouneed)\nIn today’s lab, you will not need any extra packages.",

But if you start slow, and master a few skills early on, you will find that it is not overly burdensome (and you may even find yourself enjoying it).\nWhen R executes a command, you will either see a new command prompt on the next line, or the output of what you requested. If you make a syntax error (i.e., ask R to do something it does not understand), you will get an error. Simply retype the command, correcting your mistake (did you miss a comma, quote, or parenthesis?).",

    "text": "Getting help\nFortunately, R has LOTS of help. Here are some good ways to obtain help if you are really stuck:\n\nLook hard at your screen. Is the mistake obvious (see cartoon below)?\nConsult a classmate.\nAsk me.\nConsult a help manual or book.\nAsk the internet.\nAsk ChatGPT. In all seriousness, troubleshooting error codes is an excellent use of GenAI tools as it can quickly aggregate information from a bunch of different sources that you might otherwise find yourself after great effort. The key here is, once you find the error/solution to the issue, internalizing what exactly it is that went wrong and why.\nType in a question mark before the command you are trying to use. For example, ?summary provides help on the “summary” command. This is a good way to find all of the arguments that may be used with a command, for example. Unfortunately, you may find that the help files are most useful if you are already experienced with R.\nAsk the R-help mailing list (the email address can be found through the R website, www.r-project.org). You will generally get a response in an hour or less, at any time day or night, because there are millions of useRs around the world. Often, however, the answers are provided by experienced R users, who may speak more Math than English and may have maladapted social skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro tip: 95.6% of the time, a silly spelling or syntax error is the reason behind your code is not working\n\n\n\nPro tip: Keep notes!\nIt is a good idea to keep a notes while you work. As our analyses get progressively more difficult this semester, you will find yourself needing commands from earlier in the semester. If you make your own notes of tricks and techniques that you know worked (e.g., what was the simple command I used to read in data? can I copy and paste it later?), it can avert lots of headaches in the future. What I do with every single project I am working on, is create a project_notes R Notebook file. I treat this like a digital lab notebook, recording what I do each day, issues I’m running into, ideas for future analyses or figures to make, a checklist of tasks I have yet to accomplish, and as a sandbox to play with analysis ideas/building skeletons of functions.",

    "text": "Working with batch files (“R scripts”)\nA common method of statistical analysis uses “batch files.” This is a rather old, but effective, way of conducting analyses. Essentially, one writes the programming code and sends it to the statistical software, either line by line or in large chunks. The computer runs the code, and then gives the output. That could include error messages (hopefully not!), or the answer to your analysis. The really nice thing about a batch file is that you can save it for later, and always rerun the analysis later. Think of it like writing a recipe (batch file) before putting your creation into the oven (R).\\ The most common batch file interface in R is RStudio available from http://www.rstudio.com. RStudio is a free and open source integrated development environment (IDE) for R. You can run it on your desktop (Windows, Mac, or Linux) or even over the web using RStudio Server.\\ With RStudio, you can write your batch code on one window, and then send directly to R that is running in another window (Ctrl-Enter to send a single line). You can easily save and reload your analyses later by saving the batch file with a “.R” file extension. RStudio also has the advantage of syntactic highlighting. That is, when you mouse over a parenthesis, quotes, etc., the program will highlight its partner. It is an easy way to keep track of missing punctuation that can drive a computer program (and the user!) crazy.\\ Open R studio and create a new R script (File/New File/R script…). First, save it somewhere so that you can find it back later (File/Save As…). The file will have a .R file extension that designates it as an R coding script file. You should now have a blank file named iLOVElearning.R or similar. Now close it (File/Close…).",

    "section": "Entering data into R",
    "text": "Entering data into R\nOk, seriously, if you have lots of data, you are not going to enter it like that. An easy way is to transfer it from a spreadsheet. When R reads a spreadsheet into memory, it goes into what is called a “dataframe.” Dataframes are essentially a collection of “vectors” or lists of numbers. So, each variable and its column is a vector, and all of them side-by-side in the spreadsheet make a dataframe.\\\n\nLoading Excel files directly into R\nDisclaimer; I do not use or recommend this method because there are a few “point and click” steps that are difficult to reproduce if you forget a step. I include it because many people use this method and is simple for small datasets.\\ R Studio has a tab labeled “Import Dataset” from which one can choose importation from an Excel spreadsheet. Once the file is identified, the data will be shown in a Data Preview screen. You can make adjustments (identifying rows or columns to exclude, for example), by editing options or clicking buttons at the bottom of the screen under Import Options. Notice that as you change options (e.g., excluding the first row as column names), the code that imports the data (bottom right pane) changes.\\ In the interest of reproducible results, I start with a simple text file and write the accompanying code to load that data set directly. Then I never have to worry about changes to the recipe. That method is shown below.\\\n\n\nLoading plain text files directly into R\nAt the bottom of every Excel spreadsheet are tabs. I keep three tabs in every Excel spreadsheet.\\ In the first tab, I keep all metadata or records of what the variables mean, how the data were collected, and so on. The second tab might contain the raw data as collected, and might be a little messy, perhaps with a final column of notes. The third tab is a cleaned version of my data in logical or rectangular record format, with proper column headers (just text, no special characters). To avoid problems, keep column titles to one word each. Make sure each one is different. Pay attention to capitalization vs. small case: if your spreadsheet column is named “Year,” then R will not understand if you later ask for the column named “year.” Also, avoid special characters in your column titles.\\ When preparing to import data, I first save my spreadsheet as as a regular Excel file so that Excel saves all of the tabs. I then go to the final tab where I have my cleaned data, ready for import and analysis. For this tab, I save it as a plain, tab-delimited text file (File/Save As… then choose file type as Text (tab delimited) (*.txt).\\ To load data into R, I use the read.table() command, for example:\nmyniftydata &lt;- read.table(\"D:/path/data.txt\", header=T, sep=\"\\t\", na.strings=\".\")\nBy using object-oriented programming, your data set can be referred to simply as myniftydata from now on. The read.table() command reads data files. Inside the parentheses, you provide the arguments separated by commas.\\\n\nThe first argument is the path to the data file. Enclose the path in quotes. You can make this whatever you’d like; R can read data off a network drive (H:/), your USB memory stick, or even the internet (instead of a file name, use http://www.whateverpath.com/file.txt).\\\nThe header argument is a logical True or False that indicates whether your data set contains column titles. You may abbreviate the answer to simply T or F.\nThe sep command specifies the delimiter between columns. You can change this as needed, of course. Space delimited files (sometimes called *.dat files) are sep=\" \" while comma separated files (often named *.csv files in Microsoft Excel) are sep=\",\". Because there is no “tab” character on the keyboard (like a space or comma), tab-delimited files are specified in a special way: sep=\"\\``t\".\nThe na.strings=\".\" argument tells R what denotes your missing data. A period is a good symbol to use, although sometimes asterisks or special numbers are used. In climatological data, -9 or some similar identifier is frequently used. R will take these values and change them to NA.",

For a dataset, R will list all the different variables, along with brief summary statistics for each. This is the best command to spot problems. All numerical columns will appear with summary statistics min, max, mean, etc. All columns with text, that are often indicative of categorical variables (next week’s lab), will appear with the number of observations and type of variable (i.e., character). (Value added: if you or one of your classmates knows how to convert a character column to a categorical factor variable right now, note how the summary() output changes!). If you input numerical data and see a frequency list from a summary command, there is a good chance that there is a nonnumber somewhere in the column.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nYou made it! Today’s lab is the last lab of the course (Sniff!) save for the lab exam (Whoopee!). We will cover one aspect of geostatistics today: fitting variograms.\nMany principles of lattice/areal data and spatial linear models apply to geostatistics. Both types of analyses model the spatial dependence in the error term.\nFor lattice or areal data, our spatial error models are more constrained, and thus in one sense “simpler.” Lattice methods apply where the data represent regions, rather than points, and for problems where there is a clear neighborhood structure thought to influence the process under study. In that sense, lattice or areal data give us more opportunity to construct scientifically meaningful spatial correlation models (through the neighborhood structure). For geostatistical models, the spatial error model is sometimes easier to choose, and we have a few more tools at our disposal for choosing models.\nThe boundaries between lattice and geostatistical modeling can be blurred. For example, if we are studying islands and our neighborhoods are defined in terms of inverse distance, then it is not always clear that lattice models are the most appropriate. At the same time, it is not completely clear that geostatistical approaches are the best in such cases.\n\n\nGeostatistics\nWe will focus on ordinary kriging today. That is, we will assume there is some constant but unknown mean. In other words, there is just an intercept, that’s all. This is the most common type of kriging. Of course, there is also universal kriging - the mean response depends on not only a constant but also covariates (or factors if an ANOVA). Universal kriging is a bit tricky; you must estimate the trend in order to obtain the spatial dependence in your residuals (i.e., to fit a variogram), yet the estimates of spatial error (i.e., nugget, range, sill…) also influence the estimates of your mean terms (e.g., the slopes of covariates in which you may be interested). I think you can see the challenges of circular logic here!\nUnfortunately, this is often ignored as a practical problem. If the goal is simply spatial prediction at new points, the problem is not too severe. If the problem is inference on your covariates (e.g., does soil depth and/or elevation affect probability of finding water?), the challenge is not trivial. The best theoretical routes in these cases involve Bayesian methods. We will not cover Bayesian methods in this lab, as they are a relatively advanced topic, and we are nearing the end of the course.\nThere are three major packages for dealing with geostatistical data. The first is geoR. It has some great functions for fitting variograms and fitting confidence envelopes around them, similar to putting confidence envelopes around our Ripley’s K functions in a previous lab. Another popular package is gstat. The third is a package that we have used before, nlme, which can be used to model different types of random effects, such as spatial error models in geostatistics. We will use it again today so please load nlme now.\n\n\nToday’s assignment\nToday’s data set is called “wells.” I do not know very much about it. It has 3 columns: \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\). I do not have metadata for it, although it has been used quite a bit as a training tool for exercises in ordinary kriging. I guess it also provides a valuable lesson in safeguarding your data and maintaining the metadata! Assuming this is real data, and someone did spend money collecting it, it is proof that data can walk away in a hurry if you are not careful!\nLet’s pretend the dataset contains concentrations of nitrate (NO\\(_3^-\\)) in drinking water (the z column) at different x and y locations on a \\(1 \\times 1\\) km grid. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) recommends that there should be no more than 10 ppm nitrate-nitrogen in drinking water.\n\nYou should have just loaded the nlme package. Please also load the scatterplot3d package, which is useful for visualizing data. Also, load the sp package. This package creates uniform classes for all of the different types of spatial data and objects, with a goal of making it easier to switch between different types of analyses.\n\nRead in the data. Let’s first take a look at the spatial trends. Here are a couple of ways (these will also work for visualizing marked spatial point processes):\n\n\n&gt; library(scatterplot3d)\n&gt; scatterplot3d(mydata$x, mydata$y, mydata$z, type=\"h\")\nThe optional type=\"h\" part indicates to draw drop lines to the \\(x-y\\) plane.\n&gt; library(sp)\n&gt; spatialdata &lt;- SpatialPointsDataFrame(coords=\n\\(~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\)cbind(mydata$x, mydata$y), mydata)\n&gt; bubble(spatialdata, \"z\", fill=F)\nThe fill=F instructs to avoid colouring in the circles.\n\nExamining the bubbleplot, does it look like there is spatial variation in the response? That is, do points that are closer together tend to have the same values?\nRecall that mixed effects models can handle correlated error structures; we used one example of such in our time series laboratory on repeated measures or longitudinal data. Today, we’ll model spatial dependence in the error by using a semivariogram.\nThe command that we used before was lme(). With that command, we needed to specify the model formula, the data, and the random effects (i.e., some sort of a grouping factor). However, with geostatistical data, there is typically no grouping factor. That is, we are looking at only one spatial surface (not multiple people, blocks, etc.).\nInstead of the lme() command, we will use gls(), short for generalized least squares. It behaves a lot like the lme() command, but does not specify a random effect. Instead, it specifies a correlation structure typified by a variogram (more on this later\\(\\ldots\\)). Estimation of model coefficients is still performed via maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood.\nBefore you begin this lab, it may be helpful to construct a chart to keep track of your results. Create six columns for six models (one without spatial dependence, an empirical sample variogram, and four models with two different types of spatial dependence). As you work through the lab, please clearly identify the type of model in the column heading. Complete the table with five rows for values of AIC, intercept, sill, range, and nugget. Of course, as you progress through the lab, you will notice that some rows will not have an entry (e.g., the empirical sample variogram does not have an AIC value).\nFor the first model, fit an intercept to the data using the gls() command (of course, if we were doing universal kriging, you would at this point specify some simple starting model other than just the intercept):\n&gt; fm1 &lt;- gls(z\\(\\sim\\)1, data=mydata)\nExamine the residuals with a residual plot:\n&gt; plot(fitted.values(fm1), residuals(fm1))\nWe know that the assumption of independence might be violated, but we can at least initially peek at the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity. Next, examine the summary output. We made need to take the results so far with a grain of salt, because we are not accounting for potential spatial dependence that may be skewering our significance tests (although, given the clarity of the initial result, at least when I did it, this is probably not a major concern for this data set).\nPutting concerns of spatial dependence aside temporarily,\n\nDoes it appear, statistically, that there is detectable amount of nitrate present in the well water overall (i.e., different from zero)?\nOn average, is the mean level of nitrate in a well significantly different from the maximum health standard set by the Minnesota Department of Health? (Hint: You may need to return to Question 9 on Lab 5 to answer this question. Remember to use the error degrees of freedom for your test statistic.)\n\nOk, let’s start thinking about the spatial dependence in the data. Let’s construct the sample semivariogram from our model residuals. This is the first step before we fit a theoretical model to the spatial errors:\n&gt; samplevg &lt;- Variogram(fm1, form =\\(\\sim\\)x + y, resType=\"response\")\nThe first argument contains the model under consideration. This helps R know where to find the residuals. The next argument specifies the covariate(s) to be used for specifying the distance pairs. Note that these are just the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) locations from the dataset specified in fm1 and are critical to help formulate the variogram; they have nothing to do with fitting a trend surface such as in universal kriging. The resType argument specifies the type of residuals. We will not cover standardizing our residuals in this course, so just use the raw or “response” residuals for now. There are other aguments you can add as well, such as type=\"robust\" if you’d like to use the semivariogram robust to outliers first proposed by Noel Cressie.\nExamine the sample variogram by simply typing its name and hitting Enter. These are estimates of the spatial dependence in the sample data at different distances. You will see the number of pairs in each distance bin. This is where things get a little fuzzy with regards to constructing a reliable semivariogram. For example, you will find these suggestions and guidelines in the literature:\n\nNever fit the semivariogram beyond one half (or two thirds) the maximum distance in the data\nThe number of pairs in each bin should be greater than 30\nNever compute a semivariogram unless the number of locations is greater than 200 or 300\n\nWhich guideline makes it impossible for us to continue this lab?\nYes, nice rules, but unfortunately for real life data, even following the guidelines does not guarantee a lot of precision in the estimated semivariogram. Hence, we take an approach to estimate the semivariogram with whatever data we have, then augment that with some measure (however feeble) of the precision of the estimates. This is what you frequently have to do in real life.\nPlot the sample semivariogram.\n&gt; plot(samplevg)\nThe line going through the semivariogram is a loess smoother. Essentially, this is a moving average that helps you see trends.\nAs noted above, estimating spatial correlation at the extremes of the sample space is not very reliable. Choose and report a maximum distance value that you feel is sensible.\nRefit the sample variogram, but this time specify an additional argument with your chosen value: maxDist=?. Then, plot the sample variogram again, re-specifying the maximum distance for your \\(x\\) (distance) axis:\n&gt; plot(samplevg, xlim=c(0,?))\nThis little plot may be your best friend for the next hour, so I suggest that you get aquainted. I suggest that you paste a copy into a Word document so you don’t lose her/him, or even print a copy that you can decorate with pencil marks as you estimate nuggets and ranges.\nOk, let’s fit a theoretical model to our semivariogram. Some people simply look at their plot, make a guess, and use those guesses in their final analysis. Don’t EVER do that. Seriously, what do they think statistics is for? If you do enjoy simply pulling numbers straight out of your arse and attaching scientific credibility to them, use Bayesian statistics. (You will understand this joke after we talk more about Bayesian statistics).\nWe will do something slightly different. Take a long hard look at your semivariogram. Do visually estimate and report the nugget (if any), the range, and the sill in your table. Also, estimate and report the nugget ratio. This is defined as the nugget semivariance divided by the total semivariance (represented by the sill).\nWe will use these estimates as initialization values for constructing a theoretical semivariogram. That is, the computer will attempt to determine the true values, but it appreciates some help in getting started in its optimization routine. Your initial guesses do not form part of the answer; they only help speed along the optimization routine (or at least we hope!).\nOf course, there are different types of semivariograms. This is where we typically haul out our favourite geostatistics book and look at pretty pictures to see which one matches the sample semivariogram the closest. Below I’ve reprinted a table and figure from section 5.3.2 Spatial correlation structures from José Pinherio and Douglas Bates’ book Mixed-effects models in S and S-PLUS (2000) Springer.\n\n\n\nIn this table, \\(s\\) is distance, while the correlation parameter \\(\\rho\\) is generally referred to as the range in the spatial statistics literature. The corresponding figures with range = 1 and nugget effect = 0.1 are below:\n\n\n\nLet’s play with two types of semivariogram models: exponential and spherical. First, let’s fit an exponential model (model 3 in your table):\n&gt; fm1.exp &lt;- gls(z\\(\\sim\\)1, data, corr=corExp(c(R, NR),\n\\(~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\)form =\\(\\sim\\)x + y, nugget=T))\nYou have to put numbers in place of the R and NR placeholders in the above command. These specify the range and the nugget ratio. The nugget=T just tells the program that you think there is a nugget effect. Examine the summary output:\n&gt; summary(fm1.exp)\nThe first thing you should notice is that your range and nugget are not the starting values that you specified. Rather, they reflect the maximum likelihood estimates of these parameters, based on your data and model.\n\nWhat is the value of the sill? More importantly, how did you derive it? (Yes, it is right there on your summary output, but you may need a little help).\nSome semivariogram models (like the exponential) do not have a true range, but rather report an “effective range” (even if the output says “range”). The effective range is defined as the distance at which the semivariogram value is 95% of the sill. Do you have a range or effective range, and what is its value?\n\nAt this point, you might be scratching your head at the estimate of the range when you compare it to your sample variogram. Hmmm. Well, it’s an estimate, but it doesn’t tell us anything about the variability in the estimate. What we really need is a measure of variation.\nWe could of course divide the estimate by some measure of variation to obtain a test statistic, which we could compare to a test statistic distribution to determine whether the estimate is signficantly different from zero. This is not always done with nuggets and sills and ranges, however, because it is sometimes unclear exactly how to determine the standard error, or what the appropriate test statistic distributions are.\nFor this lab, we can access 95% confidence intervals about the variogram parameter estimates, however:\n&gt; intervals(fm1.exp)\nNow, whether or not this command worked, please keep reading! If the confidence interval overlaps zero, the parameter is likely not significant. If the confidence interval varies over 5 or 10 orders of magnitude, or even returns NaN (not a number), you should be very concerned about how precise the estimates are. Who knows, it is possible that you may even get an error message indicating that the variance-covariance matrix is non-positive definite; i.e., that the confidence intervals cannot be obtained. Any or all of these can be warning signs that your variogram model is not well specified. Perhaps, for example, you are requesting an estimate of a parameter that simply is better off left out, or is so close to zero that it can’t be reliably estimated.\nThis can be frustrating. I get equally frustrated, however, with canned statistical software packages that provides an answer for anything and everything, sensible or not, because we are conditioned by the scientific community to expect answers. One of my favourite quotes comes from John Tukey (who contributed a great deal to the theory of multiple comparisons in post-hoc tests):\n\nThe combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body of data.\n\nR is nice because it can give you an answer in the summary output, but it can also tell you from looking at the intervals() command that it might be a poor answer.\nWhen I constructed this lab exercise, the nugget parameter was giving me some grief (OK, lots of grief). Refit your exponential model without the nugget (you will need to remove the nugget ratio, and specify nugget=F). Examine and enter the estimates of the range, sill, and intercept in your table, and check the intervals as before. The intervals may change, making more sense (or less), or they may be substantially similar to the previous step. Let’s compare the two models:\n&gt; anova(fm1.exp, fm1.expSansNugget)\nThis command constructs a likelihood ratio test. In other words, it compares the change in deviance between the two models, and compares that change in deviance to a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the change in the degrees of freedom (in this case, 1 df, because the second model is not estimating the nugget). If the \\(p\\)-value is not significant, it means that adding that new parameter did not explain significant variation, so you can proceed with the simpler model.\nSo, which exponential model do you prefer: the one with the nugget effect, or the one without the nugget effect?\nFit a spherical semivariogram with a nugget effect (fifth model in table). The syntax is exactly the same as before, except the correlation structure is specified as corSpher. Examine the summary, and report and comment on the values of the sill and the range. Do you think these estimates are more consistent with your sample semivariogram than the estimates from the exponential model?\nCheck the intervals on the spherical semivariogram. Then, fit a spherical semivariogram without a nugget effect (last model in table). Compare the two models with a likelihood ratio test. Is the nugget effect necessary?\nI will assume that you obtained a consistent answer for necessity of estimating a nugget for both the exponential and spherical models. If not, for learning purposes, choose both models without a nugget.\nFirst, just from visual inspection and examination of your preliminary results, which semivariogram model do you think fits the data better: exponential or spherical? Now, do a formal comparison. Because they are not nested, we cannot do a likelihood ratio test. However, we can compare them with information criteria such as AIC. Which model fits the best? Did this agree with your expert judgement?\nCompare this “best” model with your very first model without any spatial dependence specified (before you fit the sample semivariogram) using a likelihood ratio test. (The models are considered nested, because one has an intercept, and the other has an intercept plus a bunch of spatial error parameters). Was it necessary to account for spatial dependence in this dataset? (That is, was this lab a complete waste of time?)\n\nYou have just completed one of the most challenging parts of geostatistical analysis: modeling the spatial error structure in the variogram. One of the frequent goals of geostatistical data analysis is to predict new \\(z\\) values on the spatial surface, given the spatial correlation present (now that you’ve defined it). This is part of the science of kriging. A good package for prediction of new values is gstat, should you ever need it. However, we will not do that as part of this week’s exercise.",

    "text": "Producing maps in R (courtesy of Jake)\nIf you want to learn more about how to produce maps of states and counties in R, this section is for you! This is not a requirement to complete the assignment, however, so you may jump to section 3.4 and begin the assignment if you wish.\nAs with most tasks performed in R, there are many ways to produce maps. The maps package is useful for quickly producing basic maps of different countries, US states, or US states with counties. Try loading the maps and mapdata packages and typing the following commands into R:\n&gt; map(\"usa\") # Map the continental US\n&gt; map(\"state\") # Map the continental US with state boundaries\n&gt; map(\"county\") # Map the continental US with county boundaries\n&gt; map(regions = \"thailand\") # Map of Thailand\nThe maps package also provides other functions to add layers on top of a “base” map\n&gt; map(\"county\", regions = \"Wisconsin\") # A map of Wisconsin with county boundaries\n&gt; map.text(\"county\", regions = \"Wisconsin\") # Add county names to the map\nTo have more control over the maps produced and to make fancier maps, you will need to branch out into other packages. The following examples make use of the package ggplot2. The map_data() function from ggplot2 provides us with a way to access the data used in the maps package and provide more customization.\n&gt; wi &lt;- map_data(map = \"county\", region = \"Wisconsin\") # Create a dataframe of our WI polygons\n&gt; head(wi)\nEach row of the data in this dataframe corresponds to a “corner” or vertex of the county polygons you mapped previously. The polygons are organized into groups, which tells ggplot which corners should be connected by lines. We can plot this dataframe with the code below. The first function (ggplot()) tells ggplot what data to use and what variables are mapped to the x and y axes. The second function is connected to the first with a +, which is unique to ggplot code. You can link many ggplot functions together with + symbols to create graphs. The second function geom_polygon() tells ggplot that the data it is plotting should be represented as polygons with no fill color and black lines.\n&gt; ggplot(data = wi, aes(x = long, y = lat)) +\ngeom_polygon(fill = NA, color = \"black\")\nOops! We forgot to tell the ggplot function which points need to be connected by lines and which don’t. Let’s include the group variable this time. We’ll also add a few more lines to make the map look better.\n&gt; ggplot(data = wi, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +\ngeom_polygon(fill = NA, color = \"black\") +\ncoord_fixed(1.3) + # Adjusts the aspect ratio\ntheme_void() # Adds a theme to make the graphic clearer\nIf you are unfamiliar with the ggplot2 package, you can find more information by googling ggplot.\nIf you want to just plot the counties that exist in the dataset we’ll be working with today, you’ll need to take a few extra steps. First, we need to filter our map data so it only contains information for the counties we want to plot\n&gt; mydata$county &lt;- tolower(mydata$county) # convert counties to lower case to match our wi data\n&gt; wi_counties_subset &lt;- wi[wi$subregion %in% mydata$county, ] # This returns only the rows from the wi map data frame that have a county name that is also in the mydata data frame\nNow we can plot a map that includes just the subset of counties we’re working with.\n&gt; ggplot(data = wi_counties_subset, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +\ngeom_polygon(fill = NA, color = \"black\") +\ncoord_fixed(1.3) +\ntheme_void()",

    "text": "Assignment\nRead in the data. When you plot the data in a scatterplot matrix, you may see that one point suggests an unusually high number of tornadoes. Remove the row with Dodge County from the dataset. I would not ordinarily suggest this step a priori, but I want you to focus on fitting spatial models and not testing for outliers today. Unfortunately, given the short duration of this course, we have not been able to devote very much time to statistical tests for outliers.\n\nThe first thing you have to do in spatial data analysis with areal models is to identify the coordinates of your spatial units (i.e., what is your \\(x\\) column, and what is your \\(y\\) column?). For our dataset, we will use the centroids of each county. You could specify the coordinates from the dataframe in each command that you use, or you can simply stick them together into an object as I suggest:\n&gt; mycoords &lt;- cbind(data$UTMEast, data$UTMNorth)\nNote that I’ve used the included UTM coordinates instead of latitude and longitude. There are arguments you can use to specify the latter, but I strongly prefer working with continuous \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) data. That makes it easier to specify neighborhood structures by distance (e.g., everyone within 50 km, rather than 0.5 \\(\\deg\\) longitude or latitude!).\nAfter specifying your spatial coordinates, you need to construct a neighborhood structure. There are many different methods for this. I’ve listed three of the most popular here, with example syntax. (Don’t run any code here; keep reading until instructed).\n\nDistance-based; i.e., \\(d\\) nearest neighbors. Syntax:\n&gt; myneighbors &lt;- dnearneigh(mycoords, d1, d2)\nFor example, for all neighbors between 0 and 75 km away, you would specify d1=0, d2=75.\nNumber-based; i.e., \\(k\\) nearest neighbors. Syntax:\n&gt; myneighbors &lt;- knn2nb(knearneigh(mycoords, k=1, longlat=NULL))\nFor example, to specify the closest 2 neighbors, specify k=2.\nGenerate neighborhood definitions from a regular grid or lattice (not the case with today’s data). Syntax:\n&gt; myneighbors &lt;- cell2nb(nrow, ncol, type=\"rook\", torus=F) (And, you now know what the torus argument does!)\n\nThere are other methods and neighborhood structures, such as reading a shapefile and defining neighbors as those that share common borders, but I do not include that syntax here.\nSo, there you have a few different techniques. We’ll focus on distance- (\\(d\\)) and number- (\\(k\\)) based methods for this county-level data.\nPlease construct two different neighborhood structures for the tornado data:\n\nAll neighbors within 50 km\nThree nearest neighbors\n\nFor the summary() and plot() functions, you do have to specify the coordinates:\n&gt; summary(myneighbors, mycoords)\n&gt; plot(myneighbors, mycoords)\nExamine both neighborhood structures visually. Comment on their differences. Which one do you think makes the most sense for a tornado analysis?\nNow that you have a neighborhood structure (or two of them, rather), construct weighting schemes for each. The most basic is the binary coding scheme, in which cells are either defined as being neighbors (i.e., 1) or not (i.e., 0).\nmyweights &lt;- nb2listw(myneighbors, style=\"B\")\nYou can get more specialized with inverse distance weights, etc. This code is FYI only:\n&gt; dn &lt;- dnearneigh(mycoords, 0, 100)\n&gt; plot(dn, mycoords)\n&gt; dlist &lt;- nbdists(dn, mycoords)\n&gt; dlist &lt;- lapply(dlist, function(x) 1/x)\n&gt; myweights &lt;- nb2listw(dn, style=‘‘B’’, glist=dlist)\nThe above code will create neighbors of any counties that are within 100 km of each other, and define a weight that is the reciprocal of the distance between counties, scaled by the minimum distance. (But note a limitation in this approach: the distances are measured by traversing the “links” between the centroids of each county, rather than traveling in a straight line. Programming the latter is a little more complicated\\(\\ldots\\)).\nNote that the neighbor list and the weighting scheme are technically two different things! However, in R, when you create the weighting scheme, R remembers and incorporates the neighborhood structure. So, when we specify models, all we have to do is provide the weights!\nLet’s fit a model with a SAR error structure to account for spatial dependence. Here’s the syntax to fit a SAR model:\nfm1 &lt;- errorsarlm(response\\(\\sim\\)covariate(s), data=data, listw=myweights)\nFit four separate models, examining the effect of each of four covariates on the number of tornadoes. Focus on Nlat, Wlong, log(pop90), and sqrt(area) for covariates. You will notice that I have transformed two of the covariates. To date, we have focused on transforming only the response variable when necessary to fulfill model assumptions for linear models. I found when doing this assignment that the big city of Madison in Dane County created some large skew in the population variable that sometimes made it difficult to solve parameter estimates for associated model coefficients. Hence, I encourage you to also use this simple fix, even if R does not encourage you to rescale the explanatory variable). For each of the four models, use the distance-based structure with a binary weighting scheme that you have already defined.\nTake a look at your four models, each one containing one covariate. If you were using forward selection to construct a model explaining the number of tornadoes at a county level in Wisconsin, are there any variable(s) you would summarily exclude? Why?\n(Note: You may see things in the output that we have not covered in class, like \\(\\lambda\\) estimates. Don’t worry about those, as they relate to parameterizing the SAR error terms.)\n\nBuild and report a good model out of the remaining variables. Retain the same distance-based neighborhood structure throughout to keep things simple. As you might expect, judge your model(s) by the AIC values and statistical signficance of the remaining variables.\nRemember to examine the residuals of your final model:\n\nWe assume that the model has satisfactorily accounted for spatial dependence. We can utilize Moran’s test on the residuals to check the independence assumption (Assumption 2). We have a neighborhood structure and weights predefined, so we type:\n&gt; mycheck &lt;- moran.test(fm1$resid, myweights, alternative=\"two.sided\")\n&gt; mycheck\nIf the \\(p\\)-value is \\(&gt;0.05\\), Moran’s I statistic is not significantly different from zero, providing no evidence that there is spatial autocorrelation remaining in the residuals.\nFurther, we still assume that any residual error left over, even after accounting for spatial variation, is homoscedastic and normally distributed (Assumptions 3 and 4 of linear models). Hence, we examine the residual plot:\n&gt; plot(fm1$residuals\\(\\sim\\)fm1$fitted.values)\n\n\nAfter you have found a satisfactory model, change the weighting scheme.\nFit the same final model using the nearest neighbor weights, rather than the distance weights. Rather than focusing on the exact numbers of the slopes of each covariate, looks at the trends and relative magnitudes. Did the sign and significance of your model coefficients change? How about the spatial dependence, distribution, and homoscedasticity in the residuals? Is this model substantially similar to the previous one?\n\nFinally, fit the same final model, this time ignoring any spatial error structure using our old friend the lm() command. Are the results substantially similar? (i.e., slopes, significance, residual plots, etc.). While examining \\(R^2\\) values are the most conventional methods of examining regular linear regressions, you can extract an AIC value using\n&gt; AIC(mymodel)\nso you can compare it to the previous spatial fits using likelihood methods. Do a Moran test on the residuals of this model, using either the distance-based or nearest neighbor weights, looking for evidence of spatial dependence.\nExamine your results. Hmmm. Which model would you choose? Why?",

    "text": "Ripley’s K\nLoad the spatstat package today. This package was originally written by Adrian Baddeley (Curtin University), Ege Rubak (Aalborg University), and Rolf Turner (now retired, formerly of University of New Brunswick). This package is the premier package for working with spatial point process data. The two senior authors Baddeley and Turner instituted a bold change from historic classroom terminology that I like very much. For distance metrics in the K function, they use \\(r\\) for radius, which is still a type of distance, rather than \\(t\\).\n\nAfter loading the spatstat package, load the data. As usual, do a summary() to ensure the data were loaded properly. In today’s data set, the marks are a factor with two levels, so be sure to convert the type column to a factor as necessary. Again, as good practice, use the summary() command on your data set to check that your variable types are properly defined both before and after an operation.\nNow, use subsetting or row selection techniques to create two more dataframes containing only the dividing cells, and only the pyknotic cells. You should now have three data sets.\n\nTo this point in the course, when we have read in data, the resulting object has been a dataframe that we can then examine with a summary(), explore with a scatterplot matrix, etc. Today, we are going to work with a slightly different object, a planar point process, abbreviated ppp.\nConvert each dataframe to a planar point process. Here’s the relevant syntax, with explanation following:\n&gt; my.ppp.marked &lt;- ppp(x=mydata$x, y=mydata$y, window=square(1), marks=mydata$type)\nThe first two arguments in the ppp() command specify where to find the spatial locations. The window specifies what the sample area looks like. I have used the simplest specification, a square with sides of length=1. The window argument is actually very flexible; you can provide coordinates from shapefiles, polygons with holes, rectangles, and more. (See a full description in the help file using ?window if you would like to investigate further with your own data).\nThe final argument, marks, specifies where to find the marks in your dataframe (here, in the type column). Note: If you are working with a univariate dataset that only contains one type of mark (e.g., only dividing cells or only maple trees, so you only have two columns with x’s and y’s to denote the events locations), then you do not need to include the marks argument.\nYou should now have three ppp objects, one for the full dataset with marks, and one for each of your univariate subsets for dividing and pyknotic cells (without marks). Be sure to name them something meaningful.\n\nNext, do a summary() on the resulting object from the ppp() from the full dataset with marks. You should see a helpful table of the total number of cells that are dividing vs. dying, their relative proportions, and the expected intensity, \\(\\lambda\\), per unit area.\nFirst assignment question: given that the unit square in our data set is actually 250 \\(\\mu\\)m long, what is the intensity of dividing cells on a per mm\\(^2\\) basis?\nLet’s work now with the dying, pyknotic cells. As you saw in the previous question, a summary() of the point process returns the intensity and details of the window in a point process without marks. Plot the point process for the pyknotic cells (I think you can guess the syntax). The pyknotic cells will show up as circles, since there is only one type of mark.\nFrom a strictly visual examination, do you think the dying cells appear to be clustered, random, or regularly spaced?\nThe human eye is actually trained to look for patterns. As such, we are by nature terrible at visually examining and diagnosing complete spatial randomness. Hence, Ripley’s K is a useful quantitative technique. Continue working with the point process restricted to these pyknotic cells.\nThe syntax for Ripley’s K is fairly simple. We use the estimation function, Kest():\n&gt; myRipleysK.pyknotic &lt;- Kest(my.ppp.pyknotic, correction=\"best\")\nThe first argument specifies the univariate planar point process (i.e., no marks - you are only looking at one type of cell). The second argument to the function specifies the border correction.\nThe Kest() command has many different border correction options that have different statistical properties (e.g., efficiency/speed of calculation, robustness to smaller data sets, shapes of windows, etc.). One of the most useful for square or rectangular geometries is Ripley’s isotropic correction. The technique I simply recommend is to specify the option correction=\"best\". Believe it or not, the creators of the package have developed a number of rules to calculate the best method based on your data set!\nNow, plot() the resulting K function. You should see a theoretical \\(K\\) line (might be blue), with a squiggly empirical \\(\\hat{K}\\) line. What border correction did the program choose for you?\nIf you were to try different border corrections, you would likely find that they all look somewhat similar. Just for fun, calculate Ripleys’ K without the correction argument and then plot the result. The resulting graph will plot the various empirical \\(\\hat{K}\\) lines denoting differing types of border corrections.\nAny one of these empirical \\(\\hat{K}\\) line(s), while helpful, are not terribly informative, since they do not tell us how far above or below the theoretical line one needs to be to be considered “significant.”\nInstruct your computer to construct a simulation envelope. With the simulation envelope, the computer randomizes the point pattern 1,000 times, calculates the empirical K function, and then takes off a specified percentile of top and bottom runs to construct a simulation or confidence envelope. Be patient; it may take a few minutes depending on the speed of your machine!\n&gt; my.env.pyknotic &lt;- envelope(my.ppp.pyknotic, Kest, nsim=999, nrank=25)\nPlot the envelope using plot(my.env.pyknotic). You should see a nice shaded region with somewhat-symmetric upper and lower confidence lines now.\n\nWhat size of confidence interval is constructed by doing 999 simulations (in addition to the 1 real data set) and taking away the maximum and minimum 25 runs?\nHow would you change the arguments if you wanted a 99% confidence interval?\n\nIt can be difficult to see where the empirical line crosses a theoretical boundary line on a quadratic scale, so plot one of these transformations instead:\n&gt; plot(myenv, sqrt(./pi)\\(\\sim\\)r)\n&gt; plot(myenv, (sqrt(./pi)-r)\\(\\sim\\)r)\nWhat is the name of the function that you have just plotted?\nLooking at your Ripley’s K function with confidence intervals, do you see evidence of clustering or regular spacing in the pyknotic cells? Does this agree with your initial guess at what the pattern would look like from visual inspection?\n\nLet’s do some work with Ripley’s bivariate K, sometimes known as K-cross functions. First, let’s check the summary of the entire marked point process (i.e., whole data set). You may need to go back to question 1 to remember where you left it.\n&gt; summary(my.ppp.marked)\nAnd graph the process:\n&gt; plot(my.ppp.marked, cols=c(\"black\", \"red\"))\nYou can see I’ve added some colour to the graph for visual distinction. From visual inspection, do you think that the dividing cells are found next to or far away from the dying, pyknotic cells? Or is there no relation (i.e., complete spatial randomness)?\nConstruct and plot Ripley’s bivariate K function for the interaction between the dividing and pyknotic cells (i.e., using the marked point process). The syntax is identical to what you have worked with in previous questions, except that you now must (1) use Kcross() instead of Kest() to estimate the K-function (again, use the correction=\"best\" argument within Kcross()) and (2) specify the marked point process where you previously specified the univariate planar point process for pyknotic cells. Simulation envelopes are constructed as before, with a reminder that construction may take a few minutes because the computer is now randomizing two point processes multiple times.\nDo dying cells tend to be clustered, far away from, or completely independent (i.e., random) from dividing cells? If you see a significant pattern, at what spatial scale(s) does it occur? (Remember that these data have been rescaled).",

    "text": "The aggregate command\nWe often want to see how things break down in groups. R has a number of built in functions for this (tapply(), gapply(), table(), etc). I use these occasionally, but they are all derivatives of the following command: aggregate().\nIn this lab, we will experiment a little with the aggregate() command.\nSometimes, I think it could be called the “aggravate” command because the syntax can get a little confusing for large datasets. However, it is very powerful, and can give you (almost) anything you want.\nSuppose you have a dataset containing a variety of observations on cats. You want to know the average tail length and whisker length of different breeds, broken down also by sex. Here is the general structure of the command:\ncatstats &lt;- aggregate(cats[,c(\"taillength\", \"whiskerlength\")], by=list(sex=cats$sex,\n              variety=cats$breed), function(x) mean(x, na.rm=T))\n\nThe first argument, dataframe[,c(\"column\")] specifies which column variable(s) you want information on. What are you counting, taking the average of, etc.? You need to use that exact syntax: you cannot use dataframe$column.\n\nThe second argument, by=list(group1=dataframe$group1,\ngroup2=dataframe$group2) specifies how to break down the information by groups from the dataframe. Do you want the information broken down by sex? by sex and breed? These are all categorical variables (i.e., factors). You can specify as many categorical variables as you want. You may also rename each group in the new dataframe. In the example, I have renamed the breed variable to variety in the output. Generally, to avoid confusion, I keep the variable names the same.\n\nThe last argument is unusual because there is no comma between the function(x) and the specified function. The function can be whatever you want: length(x) to count the observations, mean(x) to take the average, mean(x)+\\(\\pi\\) to take the mean and add 3.14 (if you had a bizarre desire to do so), etc.. You can even write your own (very complex) functions within R. We won’t cover how to write functions in R in this course (although it is not hard). (Several years ago, someone wrote a function to order pizzas using R, a valid zip code and street address, and www.papajohnsonline.com. How cool is that?!).\n\n\n\nRemember, the aggregate() command produces a summary table (i.e., a variable custom-summarized by specified categories). In the example above, just type in the name of the table (catstats) to display it. A common mistake is overuse of the summary() command. In this instance, it would summarize the already-summarized summary table.",

As we start using these pieces every week, they will soon become less challenging. The key areas with which you should be starting to feel comfortable include reading data into R, selecting specific rows and columns, and performing both graphical and numerical summaries. The latter summaries include not only dataframe summaries but also conditional summaries (by specific categories) using something like the aggregate() command. You now have all the tools you need to start discovering neat things about your data.",

Why?\n\n\n\n\nRelated to number 1, what are the two things that we can change about an experiment/observational study, and in what direction should we change them, to increase the power of our statistical test?\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the advantage of standardizing our data using a Z-distribution (i.e., Z-score)?\n\n\n\n\nMath time! Imagine we have a random variable, \\(Y \\sim N(15, 2^2)\\). Calculate the probability that our random variable takes the values between 15 and 19 (i.e., \\(P(15 ≤ Y ≤ 19)\\)). For the p-values, you can look it them with a simple Google search (in this case, the AI answer should be correct, last I checked)"
